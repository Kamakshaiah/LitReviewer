Washington: A multi-institutional study suggests that prioritizing vaccine delivery to older age groups and the medically vulnerable has the greatest impact in minimizing loss of life. Strategic vaccine delivery is critical to reducing COVID-19 transmission, mortality and long-term health impacts affirm a study published in PLOS Computational Biology by Sam Moore, Matt Keeling and colleagues at the University of Warwick, United Kingdom. While older people are more likely to experience serious health outcomes related to COVID-19 infections, younger age groups contribute significantly to disease transmission and spread.\r\nAlso Read:\xc2\xa0COVID-19 Vaccine FAQs: Should Women Avoid COVID Vaccine During Periods? How To Use A Pulse Oximeter?\r\nIn order to test the efficacy of different vaccination strategies on minimizing deaths and hospitalisations, researchers built an age-structured model that simulated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within different regions in the United Kingdom. The authors then used the model to test multiple different scenarios, including variations in vaccine efficacy using observational data on comorbidities and social-distancing measures in the United Kingdom. The models showed that vaccine strategies prioritizing older age groups first most effectively mitigated deaths and lost quality of life years, despite the significant role of younger groups in disease spread.\r\nAlso Read:\xc2\xa0COVID Vaccination: Dos And Don\xe2\x80\x99ts To Remember As Vaccines Rollout For All Adults From May 1\r\nSince the study\xe2\x80\x99s completion in 2020, data has become available for the key assumption on vaccine uptake and specific vaccine characteristics, however, the general conclusions of the study remain relevant.\r\nAdditionally, the research has already helped guide UK policymakers in the development of an effective COVID-19 vaccination program, including the formation of the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation\xe2\x80\x99s priority groups that have been used for vaccine delivery.\r\nAlso Read: No Serious Side-Effect Attached To COVID-19 Vaccines: Director-General Of Health Services\r\nAccording to the authors, \xe2\x80\x9cWhile the ultimate success of any vaccination scheme will be highly contingent on the characteristics of the vaccine itself and the level of population uptake, as vaccines are developed which mitigate the disease, it is of great importance that they are delivered in an optimal manner \xe2\x80\x94 reducing mortality and healthcare demands.

Chronic pain has been defined as pain that persists or recurs for longer than 3 months, and it exerts an enormous personal and economic burden, affecting more than 30% of people worldwide. Even controlling for higher rates of depression, suicide, and opioid use, chronic pain is associated with a lower life expectancy.   The biopsychosocial model views pain as the denouement of a dynamic interaction among biological, psychological, and social factors. Indiscriminately prescribing medications and doing procedures based simply on a diagnosis or on symptoms will unnecessarily increase the risk:benefit ratio of therapy.

Led by an international collaboration of experts, this Commission looks at progress over the past decades and emerging challenges for RMNCAH in China. It proposes a strategic framework to achieve RMNCAH-related targets for the SDGs and Healthy China 2030 that encompasses four essential drivers: financing, workforce development, medicine and technology, and information technology systems. The recommendations proposed by the Commission are essential to improve access, equity, and quality of RMNCAH services, to build a healthy and friendly environment for every woman, child, and adolescent domestically, and improve global governance in RMNCAH.\r\nDespite being responsible for causing 35% of deaths in women each year, cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women remains understudied, under-recognised, under-diagnosed, and under-treated, with women under-represented in clinical trials. To tackle these inequities, 17 experts from 11 countries have authored the first-ever global report on CVD in women. The all -female-led Commission outlines 10 ambitious new recommendations to tackle inequities intargeting diagnosis, treatment, and prevention to reduce CVD in women, including educating health care providers and patients on early detection to prevent heart disease in women; scaling up heart health programs in highly populated and underdeveloped regions; and prioritising sex-specific research on heart disease in women and intervention strategies for women.\r\nThe Lancet sets extremely high standards.

Here, we investigate the expected outcomes of the interplay between vaccination rollout and adaptive mitigation measures constantly altering the epidemic trajectory and keeping the reproduction number around the unit. Using a novel mathematical modeling framework, we estimate that, for vaccination capacities of at least 4 daily doses administered per 1,000 inhabitants, a complete release of mitigation measures can be expected within 7 to 13 months since the start of vaccination, with a two-year cumulative incidence of deaths between 0.18 and 0.46 per 1,000 population. A heavier burden of deaths and a delayed \xe2\x80\x9creturn-to-normal\xe2\x80\x9d is expected for lower vaccine capacities, if viral transmissibility exceeds by >60% the one estimated at the beginning of the pandemic, or if vaccine protection is short-lived. Failure to prioritize the elderly or a premature release of mitigation measures after vaccination of the most fragile will conspicuously increase the expected mortality. Finally, strategies oriented to prioritize the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 by maintaining strict restrictions will take a similar time as a mitigation approach, possibly resulting in acceptability issues. Persisting unknowns about the evolving epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 variants and on the effectiveness of available and upcoming vaccines may warrant a future reassessment of these conclusions.\r\nSince December 2020, vaccinations against COVID-19 are being rolled out in many countries of the world, in a race to put an end to a pandemic that has caused millions of lives lost [1], devastating economic effects [2], and a tremendous impact on mental health [3]. Limitations in the supply of COVID-19 vaccines and in the logistics of rollout imply that several months will elapse before immunization campaigns can have a significant impact [4]. Meanwhile, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) will remain the main tool to maintain control of the epidemic. While China and a few other countries in South-East Asia and Oceania have successfully pursued a zero-COVID policy [5] with suppression of transmission via aggressive localized lockdown policies and strict border control, most countries in the world resorted to mitigation strategies [6], adjusting physical distancing restrictions (PDRs) in the attempt to balance a low level of viral circulation with individual freedoms and economic losses. In practice, this balance is not always achieved as desired, resulting in an alternance between periods of constant or declining circulation and new resurgences, to which correspond phases of relaxation and intensification of PDRs. Projecting the impact of vaccination under unstable conditions is complex and most approaches today have assumed constant restrictions and various degrees of epidemic severity while vaccination is implemented [4, 7-10]. Here, we propose a different approach by simulating the effect of a vaccine rollout under perfect mitigation, i.e., assuming that governments will be capable to maintain an approximately constant incidence by adjusting PDRs as immunity accumulates.\r\nWe developed a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, structured by age and accounting for age-specific susceptibility, contacts, and prevalence of comorbidities. Incidence is maintained approximately constant over time during vaccine rollout by continuously recalibrating a scaling factor, roughly representing the proportion of pre-pandemic contacts allowed by the existing PDRs (see Appendix). As population immunity accrues due to natural infection and vaccination, the proportion of allowed contacts will increase until all pre-pandemic contacts are eventually resumed, representing the process of PDRs relaxation.\r\nThe impact of vaccination is quantified in terms of cumulative deaths and of the relaxation of PDRs. The latter is reported as the percent increase in allowed contacts, with 0% representing restrictions needed to have a constant incidence at the start of the vaccination program, and 100% representing complete reopening. Additionally, we estimate the time to \xe2\x80\x9czero-COVID\xe2\x80\x9d defined as no reported cases for at least two consecutive weeks; by zero-COVID we refer to a situation similar to the one achieved by countries in Asia and Oceania, where no cases are usually detected but local flare-ups may occur due to importation of cases (e.g., outbreaks in under-vaccinated communities). We take Italy as a case study and simulate the process over a time horizon of two years.\r\nAs a baseline, we consider a two-dose vaccination campaign under the following assumptions: i) an incidence of reported cases maintained at about 50 cases per week per 100,000 population; ii) a vaccination coverage of 75%; iii) a daily capacity of 4 doses per 1,000 population; iv) prioritization based on the WHO SAGE roadmap [11] (Appendix); v) vaccines prevent infection; vi) protection is long-lasting (> 2 years); vii) vaccine is administered independently of a previous COVID-19 infection. These assumptions are then modified in a number of alternative scenarios and sensitivity analyses.\r\nIn the absence of vaccination and under mitigation measures, we estimate 1.68 cumulative COVID-19 deaths per 1,000 population (95%CI: 0.95-2.79), occurring uniformly over the two years (Figure 1A). The natural immunity achieved by viral circulation allows a limited relaxation of PDRs, estimated between 20 and 30% in the fourth semester (Figure 1B), with a large residual potential for new epidemic waves: the effective reproduction number at the end of simulations is estimated at 1.4-1.6 (Appendix). These results suggest that in the absence of vaccination, the only viable way to control COVID-19 infections would be to maintain strict PDRs in the very long term.\r\nA) Estimated incidence of deaths within each of the four simulated semesters. B) Average amount of PDRs relaxation over each semester. Bars indicate the mean and vertical lines the 95% projection interval. C) overall comparison using the cumulative incidence of deaths and the average relaxation of PDRs over the two simulated years. Individual stochastic simulations are shown as points, the mean of their bivariate distribution as crosses and its 75-percentile as closed curves.\r\nIn the baseline scenario, the vaccination campaign is expected to be completed after about 13 months. Vaccination can limit cumulative deaths to 0.36 per 1,000 (95%CI: 0.21-0.59), i.e., almost 80% less than in absence of vaccination (Figure 1A). In addition, PDRs might be completely relaxed by month 12, with most of the relaxation occurring rapidly over the second semester (Figure 1B), and zero-COVID might be achieved after about 18 months (95%CI: 17-20).\r\nThe effect of a vaccination campaign may depend on several factors. Some of these depend on organizational and public health choices, e.g., how fast available vaccine doses are administered, or which population segments are prioritized. A halved vaccination capacity (2 daily doses per 1,000 population) would imply a completion of the program after over 2 years, with continued circulation after that date. In addition, it would result in a higher mortality compared to the baseline (0.63 per 1,000; 95%CI: 0.36-1.03) and in a slower relaxation of PDRs, which is expected to be complete by month 21 (95%CI: 19-22, Figure 2A). Vaccination capacities higher than the baseline would have a limited impact on the burden of deaths, but they would allow a quicker relaxation of PDRs, reaching complete reopening at month 9 and 8 for vaccination capacities of 6 and 8 daily doses per 1,000 population, respectively. Simulations of alternative prioritizations (details in Appendix) suggest that targeting population segments with highest contact rates may allow a more rapid relaxation of PDRs (3 to 5 months earlier than the baseline when prioritizing schoolchildren, but only 1 month earlier when prioritizing working-age adults), at the cost of a two- to three-fold mortality burden compared to the baseline (Figure 2B).\r\nA) vaccination capacities; B) vaccine prioritizations (details in Appendix); C: vaccine coverages; D) duration of vaccine protection. Top panels show the estimated incidence of deaths within each of the four simulated semesters. Middle panels show the average amount of PDRs relaxation over each semester. Bars indicate the mean and vertical lines the 95% projection interval. Bottom panels compare scenarios using the cumulative incidence of deaths and the average relaxation of PDRs over the two simulated years. Individual stochastic simulations are shown as points, the mean of their bivariate distribution as crosses and its 75-percentile as closed curves.\r\nThe population\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to receive the vaccine is represented by the achievable coverage. A 60% coverage would anticipate the relaxation of PDRs by switching earlier from high-risk to high-transmission population segments, but it would result in about 0.46 cumulative deaths per 1,000 population (95%CI: 0.26-0.79) in two years (Figure 2C). Conversely, an increased coverage to 90% would not significantly reduce the mortality burden, but it would delay the complete relaxation of PDRs by about 1.5 months compared to the baseline.\r\nOne of the main unknowns on vaccine performance is the duration of vaccine protection. When assuming that protection wanes on average 1 year or 6 months after administration, in absence of a re-vaccination campaign we estimate a steep resurgence of deaths starting from the third semester, and the need to reinstate stricter PDRs during the fourth semester to counter the rising reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 driven by the refueling of the susceptible reservoir. In these scenarios, we estimate 1.34-1.57 deaths per 1,000 population (with a wide uncertainty ranging from 0.63 to 2.56 per 1,000, Figure 2D) in two years. We note however that the end of the vaccination campaign around month 13 in the baseline scenario implies that even with a short duration of vaccine protection, re-vaccination is feasible before the deterioration of the epidemiological situation, if vaccine stockpiles/supplies are sufficient.\r\nAnother major uncertainty in the evolving SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is the emergence of viral lineages with increased transmissibility [12-14]. We tested the effect of vaccine rollout assuming a transmissibility that is 20% to 80% higher than what estimated initially for SARS-CoV-2. In such case, we expect a possibly substantial increase in total deaths by up to 140% higher for transmissibility increased by 80% (Figure 3A) and by up to 290% when considering also a higher lethality of the variants [15-16] (Appendix). Zero-COVID is generally not achieved in two years unless the increase in transmissibility remains below 20%. PDRs will have to be intensified in the first semester compared to the baseline (represented in Figure 3A by negative values), maintaining levels similar to the baseline\xe2\x80\x99s initial ones throughout the second semester; however, the complete relaxation is expected within month 14 (95%CI 13-15) even with a transmissibility increased by 60%. Only in the worst case we expect a complete reopening later than month 17.\r\nA) increased transmissibility; B) limits to PDR relaxations to suppress transmission; C) complete reopening after immunization of the most fragile. Top panels show the estimated incidence of deaths within each of the four simulated semesters. Middle panels show the average amount of PDRs relaxation over each semester. Bars indicate the mean and vertical lines the 95% projection interval. Bottom panels compare scenarios using the cumulative incidence of deaths and the average relaxation of PDRs over the two simulated years. Individual stochastic simulations are shown as points, the mean of their bivariate distribution as crosses and its 75-percentile as closed curves.\r\nWe evaluated the sensitivity of model outputs with respect to several other variables (Appendix). When allowing incidence levels higher than 50 weekly cases per 100,000, the accumulation of immunity from natural infections speeds up the relaxation of PDRs but the death burden increases proportionally. When considering a vaccine efficacy reduced by 15%, we found up to 50% more deaths, with minimal impact on the time to complete relaxation of PDRs. If the vaccine provides protection against disease, but not against infection, we expect a doubled number of deaths at the end of the two years, and PDRs would not be relaxed by more than 40%. A homogeneous susceptibility to infection (rather than reduced in children and increased in older adults [17-18]) would reduce deaths by 40%. Finally, model results were substantially insensitive to uncertainties in the value of initial immunity.\r\nGovernments may choose to use the population immunity conferred by vaccines to achieve zero-COVID sooner by not lifting PDRs until it is safe to do so without the risk of new resurgences. Mixed strategies may also be adopted where PDRs are lifted up to a certain point, and then priority is given to suppression. When no relaxation of PDRs is allowed since the start of vaccination, zero-COVID would be anticipated at month 12 since vaccination start (95%CI: 10-13, Figure 3B), after which a complete reopening could be safe due to the below-threshold transmission potential (Appendix). We estimate a cumulative incidence of 0.18 deaths per 1,000 population (95%CI: 0.11-0.30) for this scenario, roughly half than the baseline. When allowing a 25%, 50% or 75% relaxation of PDRs before aiming for suppression, zero-COVID would occur on month 14, 16 and 17, and the resulting cumulative incidence of deaths would be 0.28 (0.17-0.46), 0.33 (0.19-0.54) and 0.35 (0.20-0.58) per 1,000 (Figure 3B).\r\nAn opposite strategy might be to maintain mitigation measures until the most fragile population segments (individuals above 60 years of age or with comorbidities) are protected. After this milestone, occurring around month 6 since vaccination start under baseline assumptions, all PDRs are completely removed. Despite the protection of the high-risk population, a high incidence of cumulative deaths is expected (1.14 per 1,000, 95%CI: 0.70-1.63, Figure 3C), due to a large epidemic wave that would occur following the premature dismission of mitigation measures.\r\nA summary comparison of key results for all considered scenarios is represented in Figure 4.\r\nRed circles show the mean estimated mortality burden over the two years with shaded areas representing the 95% projection intervals. Bars show the mean time to zero-COVID and horizontal lines the 95% projection interval. Fading bars indicate no zero-COVID on average within 24 months; for scenarios with 60% coverage and 20% increased transmissibility, about 30% and 93% of simulations are expected to result in zero-COVID before month 24 respectively (dashed horizontal lines). Vertical lines indicate the end of vaccination programs (fixed, given capacity and coverage). A dashed vertical line indicate completion after 24 months. Blue points and horizontal blue lines indicate the mean and 95% projection interval for the time at which a complete relaxation of PDRs is reached. For scenarios with limited relaxations of PDRs, blue lines are not shown because complete relaxation occurs when zero-COVID is achieved.\r\nWe examined the effect of COVID-19 vaccination programs in countries which were not able, to date, to suppress circulation of the virus. Under the assumption that existing vaccines confer protection from infection (rather than just disease) and that immunity is long-lived (>2 years), the combination of vaccine roll-out and effective mitigation strategies is expected to prevent a large proportion of deaths while at the same time allowing a progressive lifting of physical distancing restrictions. A complete return to a pre-pandemic lifestyle can be expected between 7 and 15 months since the start of vaccination in most scenarios (Figure 4), provided that a vaccination capacity of at least 4 doses per 1,000 population per day is achieved. Zero-COVID, i.e., suppression of transmission similar to the one observed in some Asian and Oceanian countries, would occur approximately 6 months thereafter. Higher capacities are not expected to produce major reductions in the number of deaths but will help release restrictions more rapidly. Another critical parameter will be the duration of vaccine-induced protection: if vaccine protection will last 1 year or less on average, re-vaccination must be deployed as soon as the primary campaign is over (13 months since its start in the baseline case); otherwise, the relaxation of PDRs will need to be reversed at some point, and the number of deaths will rise dramatically. We also explored the impact of more transmissible variants [12-14]: stricter mitigation measures than those existing in many countries in December 2020 are required throughout at least the first semester, but the timing to complete reopening should remain within 15 months as long as the increase in transmissibility does not exceed 60% compared to historical lineages. In any case, the additional transmissibility will result in a much larger number of lives lost (up to four-fold the baseline value if variants are also more lethal [15-16]).\r\nWe also evaluated the possibility that countries will relax PDRs only up to a certain point, using the buildup of population immunity to pursue suppression of transmission. In the case that no relaxation of PDRs is allowed, zero-COVID can be obtained in about 12 months, after which the transmission potential will have fallen below the epidemic threshold and a complete reopening may be allowed. This suppression-oriented approach requires a similar time until complete reopening than the mitigation approach with a halved burden of deaths. However, the tradeoff here is the need to maintain restrictions for a long period, with negative effects on the economy and population\xe2\x80\x99s mental health and likely acceptability issues for the public, faced with a steadily declining incidence. On the opposite, pressures to reopen society may be expected after the daily incidence of deaths will have dropped to low values due to the vaccination of the most fragile. We show that if social contacts are completely resumed after the vaccination of fragile individuals is completed (about 6 months into the vaccination program), a major epidemic is to be expected with a large death toll.\r\nThere are a number of limitations that must be kept in mind when interpreting our results. First, we did not explicitly model which PDRs are relaxed as vaccination progresses; instead, we assumed a generic relaxation of measures that impacts all ages proportionally. The age-specific effect of relaxing existing PDRs is extremely hard to quantify, and their prioritization is a peculiarly political decision, depending on the governments\xe2\x80\x99 strategic interests. Second, we assume mitigation measures to maintain an approximately constant incidence; although this dynamic is clearly idealized, we consider this an acceptable approximation of the fluctuating incidence observed in most countries. We anticipate that possible resurgences due to imperfect mitigation will contribute to speed up the population immunity and therefore the relaxation of PDRs, however at the cost of more lives lost. Third, we did not explicitly model the effect of other possible features of emerging variants, such as reductions in vaccine effectiveness [19-20] or the ability to escape natural immunity [13, 21-22], or a combination of them. We estimate that a 15% lower efficacy of vaccines under the transmissibility of historical lineages would imply an increase in deaths of up to 50%, without affecting the time to a complete relaxation of PDRs. The possibility of escape from natural immunity is not expected to be a major driver of our conclusions, considering the limited share of population immunity due to natural infection even in scenarios without vaccination (up to 30% at the end of the two years) and to the fact that vaccination is administered independently of a previous COVID-19 infection [23]. Similar considerations apply to the possibility that immunity from natural infection wanes over time [24].\r\nFourth, we assume that vaccines will protect from infection. This seems to be the case for at least some of the licensed vaccines, according to recent studies [25-27]; however, it needs to be further confirmed also for other vaccines under approval and with respect to circulating variants. In the unlikely case that vaccines only avoid symptomatic disease with no reduction on susceptibility nor infectiousness, our simulations suggest dramatically different results, especially in terms of the ability of countries to relax PDRs. Fifth, we did not consider possible changes in viral transmissibility due to seasonality, such as the closure of schools or the larger amount of time spent outdoors during the summer. This may help reduce deaths and expand the margins for reopening during the summer.\r\nFinally, we assumed that vaccination for children under 16 years old will be available before month 11, when the program is scheduled to be extended to school-aged children in the majority of scenarios. Although there are no licensed pediatric vaccines against COVID-19 yet, several manufacturers have already started phase 2/3 trials for children as young as 3 years old [28]. Therefore, the expectation of having an effective vaccine in the second half of the year is not unrealistic.\r\nThere are still many uncertainties on characteristics of vaccines and on the evolving epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. However, we show that vaccination programs under mitigation scenarios may allow a return to normal within one year since their start if a sufficient capacity and coverage is achieved. The epidemiological characteristics of emerging variants, especially with respect to their increased transmissibility and the effectiveness of vaccines, will need to be closely monitored to promptly reassess these conclusions as more evidence will become available.\r\nData used in the manuscript are publicly available.\r\nM.A. has received research funding from Seqirus.

Routine childhood immunization may be adversely affected by COVID-19 mitigation measures. We aimed to identify the prevalence of delayed immunization and explore the reasons and barriers for delayed immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online self-administered questionnaire for parents of children under two years of age during the period from 1 May to 30 June 2020. Most of the 749 participants (82.6%) were mothers, with 31 to 40 years being the most common age group (49.8%). Nearly three-quarters (73.2%) of the parents had appointments scheduled for their child\xe2\x80\x99s vaccination during the pandemic, and approximately 23.4% of the parents reported a delay of more than one month in the immunization of their child. The most common reason for the delay was the fear of being infected by COVID-19 (60.9%). Large household size and lack of insurance were risk factors for immunization delay. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the timeliness of routine childhood immunization in Saudi Arabia. Childhood immunization should be prioritized, as well as the implementation of focused strategies to achieve significant and sustainable vaccination rates during pandemics.\r\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a threat to public health and healthcare systems worldwide [1]; prompting governments to implement numerous interventions such as curfews, extensive screening measures and travel bans to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 [2]. School closure has been a vital intervention strategy to curb community transmission during the pandemic [3,4]. Although these strategies are crucial, concerns have arisen regarding lengthy school closures and home quarantine, which may negatively impact children\xe2\x80\x99s mental and physical health [2,5]. Furthermore, disruptions to healthcare services may result in childhood immunization being missed or delayed, which is a significant concern [6,7]. Vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) remains an important issue that requires adherence to recommendations to prevent severe illness in children [8]. Delayed or missed vaccination makes children susceptible to certain preventable diseases and may also affect herd immunity [9]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), VPD is a threat to 80 million children worldwide because of the disruption of healthcare systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic [10]. In addition, vaccination against influenza may help decrease the severity of disease in patients who experience co-morbid COVID-19 and influenza infections [11,12].\r\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of deferred vaccinations varied across countries. For instance, only 25% of children received vaccinations timeously in the United States [12,13]. In Saudi Arabia, the delay of vaccinations ranged from 9% to 24% due to various factors, such as unavailability of the vaccine in some primary healthcare facilities and traveling when vaccination was due [14,15].\r\nAdministering vaccinations in a timely manner is crucial but may be affected by various factors. Natural disasters, for example, may have a negative impact on vaccination rates and timeliness, leading to infectious disease outbreaks [6,16]. Thus, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding the disruption of childhood immunization to prevent VPD outbreaks [17]. The Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) also recommends that childhood vaccinations should be given timeously during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nTo date, there are few reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on childhood immunization. In this study, we aimed to identify the prevalence of delayed vaccinations and uncover the reasons and barriers for delayed immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate delays in childhood vaccinations. The findings of our research will be pertinent to recognizing the obstacles to vaccination timeliness during public health emergencies and thereby aid in the implementation of strategies at the national level for pandemic preparedness.\r\nA descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire comprising 25 questions. The questionnaire was designed to measure the prevalence of, and reasons for, delays in childhood vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The study population included parents from different cities of the Qassim region who had a child under two years of age during the period from 1 March to 30 June 2020. Parents who did not have children below the age of two were excluded. We conducted a nonprobability convenience sampling of parents via the WhatsApp application using the Google platform between 1 May and 30 June. We chose 12 medical students to distribute the questionnaire and collect data from parents in different cities in Qassim. The participants gave consent before commencing the questionnaire.\r\nThe Qassim region is located in the center of Saudi Arabia and has a population of approximately 1.5 million, of which 80.4% are Saudi citizens. The national childhood immunization schedule targets 16 VPDs at various stages, beginning at birth and subsequently at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. The vaccines are for hepatitis B, diphtheria\xe2\x80\x93tetanus\xe2\x80\x93pertussis, polio, Hemophilus influenzae type B, rotavirus, pneumococcal infections, bacillus Calmette\xe2\x80\x93Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG), hepatitis A, measles, varicella, meningococcal infections, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and human papillomavirus (HPV).\r\nThe questionnaire was validated in two steps. Initially, it was reviewed by three academic experts in the field to evaluate the quality and bias in the survey. Then, the questionnaire was pretested on 20 parents who were subsequently excluded from the current analysis. Minor language modification was performed based on expert suggestions. The survey was conducted in Arabic for the participants.\r\nThe questionnaire comprised four sections: parents\xe2\x80\x99 demographic data; current immunization status and attitude toward immunization delay; immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic; and possible reasons that prevented parents from vaccinating their child or children.\r\nVaccination delay was defined as vaccinations that took place one month or more after the designated time.\r\nParents\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly disagree\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly agree\xe2\x80\x9d. Responses such as \xe2\x80\x9cagree\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly agree\xe2\x80\x9d were coded with 1 point. Responses such as \xe2\x80\x9cneutral,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdisagree,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly disagree\xe2\x80\x9d were coded with 0 points. A negative question was included and reverse-coded to avoid bias. The overall score of attitudes was calculated by summing the scores of the 3 questions. The attitude score range was from 0 to 3 points, which indicated that the higher the score, the more positive the attitude toward the timeliness of vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. By using a score of 2 as the cutoff point to determine the level of attitude, parents were classified as having a negative attitude if the score was from 0 to 1 point, and as having a positive attitude if the score was from 2 to 3 points.\r\nData were summarized with numerical values, percentages, means and standard deviation whenever appropriate. For comparisons, a Mann\xe2\x80\x93Whitney U test or a Kruskal\xe2\x80\x93Wallis test was applied. Normality, statistical interactions and collinearity (i.e., variance inflation factor) were also assessed using Kolmogorov\xe2\x80\x93Smirnov and Shapiro\xe2\x80\x93Wilk tests. The relationship between length of delay in childhood vaccination, consistent, timely childhood vaccinations and preferred vaccination locale during the pandemic was calculated using a chi-squared test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant for all statistical tests. All data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0.\r\nApproval from the Qassim regional research ethics committee was granted (IRB# H-04-Q-001).\r\nIn total, 802 parents were invited to participate in the study, and 53 participants were excluded due to incomplete questionnaires. We included 749 participants in the analysis, as shown in Table 1. Mothers were predominantly higher in number (82.6%) than fathers (17.4%), with 31 to 40 years being the most common age group (49.8%). Most parents obtained a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree (78.4%). Findings showed that 9.9% of the participants were working in the medical field. Furthermore, 38.9% reported having one child. Nearly all participants (93.5%) stated that they currently had one child under two years.\r\nSociodemographic characteristics of parents (n = 749).\r\nSAR\xe2\x80\x94Saudi riyal; PHC\xe2\x80\x94primary healthcare center.\r\nIn assessing awareness of COVID-19 risk in children, our findings showed that the proportion of parents who believed \xe2\x80\x9cchildren could be infected with COVID-19\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cchildren can transmit COVID-19\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCOVID-19 illness in children can lead to child hospitalization\xe2\x80\x9d were 73.2%, 74.2% and 73.4%, respectively.\r\nThe parents\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes regarding the timeliness of childhood vaccination showed that the proportion of parents who \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly agreed\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the statement \xe2\x80\x9cvaccinations are essential to keep children healthy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvaccinations should be given at the scheduled time\xe2\x80\x9d were 73.6% and 53.9%, respectively. Conversely, the proportion of parents who \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly agreed\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the statement \xe2\x80\x9cvaccination delay is not a problem as you give all vaccines regardless of the due time for your child\xe2\x80\x9d was low, with only 6.3%. Based on these three attitude statements, the mean attitude score was 2.25 (SD = 0.73), with nearly all parents (90%) classified as having a positive attitude, while the rest (10%) were classified as negative. When comparing the attitude score versus the sociodemographic characteristics of parents, it was observed that parents with one child were significantly more likely to have better attitudes than those with two or more children (F = 2.712; p = 0.006), as shown in Table 2.\r\nAssessment of parents\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes concerning childhood vaccination timeliness during COVID-19 (n = 749).\r\nSA\xe2\x80\x94strongly agree; A\xe2\x80\x94agree; N; neutral; D\xe2\x80\x94disagree; SD\xe2\x80\x94strongly disagree.\r\nOverall, 73.2% of the parents had appointments scheduled for their child\xe2\x80\x99s vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, approximately 47.8% of the parents reported a delay of more than two weeks in the immunization of their child. A significant delay of more than one month was observed in 23.4% of the cases. However, 52.2% reported that the scheduled vaccine was given on time or within two weeks of the due date. Almost 73% of the respondents were aware of the MOH recommendation. The most common source of information was social media sites (49.5%).\r\nOf those who had a child scheduled for immunization during the pandemic, 73% were aware of MOH recommendations for vaccinations. Nearly 70% of the parents received this information through social media, and 30% through TV or newspapers.

Other reasons mentioned by parents were traveling during the vaccination time, vaccine unavailability or closed clinics (6.7%).\r\nReasons for vaccination delays.\r\nWhen parents were asked about their preferred locale for vaccination, most of the parents preferred to vaccinate their children at home (36.6%) or at primary healthcare facilities dedicated to vaccination only (35.1%). However, only 17.8% reported that they would continue to obtain childhood vaccinations at hospitals or other healthcare centers as usual (see Figure 3).\r\nPreferred locale for child vaccination during the pandemic.\r\nTable 3 depicts the univariate and multivariate regression analyses to determine which factors were associated with delayed vaccination of more than one month among parents who had scheduled child vaccinations during the pandemic. Findings revealed that the chance of delaying vaccinations for participants in the 31\xe2\x80\x9340 years age group was twice as high as that of the 18\xe2\x80\x9330 years age group (p = 0.011); however, in the multivariate regression model, the results became insignificant. The univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that the chance of delayed vaccination for participants with multiple children was three times more likely than for those with only one child (p < 0.001). Additionally, participants with medical insurance were less likely to delay their children\xe2\x80\x99s vaccinations than those without medical insurance (p = 0.043).\r\nUnivariate and multivariate regression model for determining factors associated with delayed vaccination (more than one month) (n = 548).\r\nUOR\xe2\x80\x94unadjusted odds ratio; AOR\xe2\x80\x94adjusted odds ratio; CI\xe2\x80\x94confidence interval; SAR\xe2\x80\x94Saudi riyal. ** Significant at p < 0.05 level.\r\nThe present study assessed the prevalence of, and reasons for, delayed childhood vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the timeliness of childhood immunization in the Qassim region of Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on childhood immunization in Saudi Arabia.\r\nSeveral reports have suggested that childhood vaccination has been affected by the pandemic. Abbas et al. suggested that the risk of death due to VPD outweighed the risk of death due to possibly contracting COVID-19 during clinic visits [18]. After the national emergency declaration in the USA, a reduction in routine vaccinations was observed, primarily in children older than one month [19]. Moreover, an almost 20% decline in MMR vaccination was observed in England. The hexavalent vaccination also decreased, although less significantly than that of MMR [20]. However, in Pakistan, a substantial reduction in immunization of 52% was reported during the lockdown period. Reports indicate that the outreach vaccination service was affected more than fixed center services [21]. In our study, parents reported an almost 24% vaccination delay in routine vaccination during the first three months of the pandemic. The results of previous reports are consistent with our findings. However, previous reports were dependent on vaccination prescriptions to measure the trend of vaccination. In our study, we relied on parental reports regarding vaccination delays.\r\nIn the current study, household size was a risk factor for vaccination delay, consistent with previous research confirming the association between larger household size and vaccination delay among children [15,22]. This may be due to an increase in parental tasks, causing parents to miss vaccinations as a result of being overwhelmed. Moreover, uninsured families were at risk of delayed vaccination. In Saudi Arabia, vaccination is provided free of charge for all families under the government\xe2\x80\x99s primary healthcare system. However, insured families also have access to care from the private sector as well as the government\xe2\x80\x99s primary healthcare system. On the other hand, two-thirds of the delayed vaccinations occurred among children aged 12 months and younger. This finding is inconsistent with a report from the USA, in which they targeted and promoted vaccination in younger age groups during the pandemic. Indeed, routine childhood immunization should be prioritized in younger children.\r\nThe study revealed that most parents had a positive attitude toward the importance of timely vaccinations. In contrast, a previous study in Saudi Arabia showed that 65% of parents were not concerned about vaccination delays. The difference in findings may be attributed to improved parental vaccination awareness through primary care providers, MOH and the media [14]. Prior international studies have found parental education to be significantly associated with a positive attitude toward different types of vaccinations [23,24].\r\nAs expected, the fear of contracting COVID-19 was the most common reason for vaccination delays. Further reasons included the unavailability of vaccination appointments due to the lockdown and resultant healthcare service limitations. This is consistent with findings indicating the potential causes of missed vaccinations during the pandemic in the USA [19]. Surprisingly, advice received from healthcare service providers was another reason given by the parents to delay vaccinations. This may be due to the ambiguity of immunization recommendations and initial stay-at-home orders at the onset of the pandemic. Due to the fear of COVID-19 infection, most families who delayed their child\xe2\x80\x99s vaccination preferred to get their child vaccinated at home or attended to by healthcare staff solely dedicated to administering vaccinations. In Saudi Arabia, there was a home vaccination program during the influenza season aimed at increasing influenza vaccine coverage [25]. Thus, implementing home vaccination during a pandemic should be considered to increase vaccination rates, particularly for high-risk children. Moreover, many healthcare service providers in the USA have allotted vaccination appointments exclusively to the mornings, while sick patients are scheduled for later in the day. Other practices request that families wait in their vehicles until the exam room is ready, thereby avoiding contact between families [19,26].\r\nWhile the findings of this study are significant, the study is not without limitations. Specifically, the study was conducted in a single region in Saudi Arabia that may not be representative of the entire population. Additionally, the measurement of attitude may be imprecise due to the limited number of questions. Moreover, this study may have introduced some recall bias, and the results may be influenced by subjectivity. Nevertheless, this study provides an important understanding of the overall picture regarding immunization delay in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic. Thus, the findings may be used as a reference for outlining strategies to improve routine vaccination program coverage during natural disasters and pandemics.\r\nWe identified that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the timeliness of routine childhood vaccinations in Saudi Arabia. The results of our study demonstrated numerous barriers to timeous immunization. We suggest that routine childhood vaccination be prioritized and focused strategies implemented to achieve a significant and sustainable increase in vaccinations during pandemics.\r\nWe wish to thank Abdullah Aljlajle, Amar Alsawyan, Reem Albatshan, Remah Alsuhaibani, Ahmed Alrashidi, Ohud Alfawzan, Haneen Almohaimeed, Bayan Alsaqaby, Abdulrahman Alturki, Mzoun Alotaibi, Waad Almutairi and Abdulaziz Almohaimeed for their help with the distribution of questionnaires.\r\nConceptualization, M.A.; methodology, M.A.; software, M.A., validation, A.A. formal analysis, M.A. investigation, A.A.; resources, A.A.; data curation, A.A.; writing\xe2\x80\x94original draft preparation, A.A. and M.A.; writing\xe2\x80\x94review and editing M.A.; visualization, A.A.; supervision, M.A.; project administration, M.A. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\r\nResearchers would like to thank the Deanship of Scientific Research, Qassim University for funding publication of this project.\r\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Center for\r\n                        Biotechnology Information,\r\n                 U.S. National Library of Medicine\r\n\r\n8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda\r\nMD, 20894\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\nShowing items related by title and subject\r\n\r\nShow Statistical Information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa9 \r\n            WHO\r\n         2020\r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: \r\nAs a country with the highest death toll due to COVID-19 in Southeast Asia [1], the rapidly escalating health crisis has prompted the government of Indonesia to provide against the worst scenario for the impact of this pandemic through pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Health crises and emergencies have been omnipresent and habitually unpredictable in duration and location. With increasing awareness of stakeholders and communities, responses to this pandemic situation should be more systematic and well-organized with adequate timing. Apart from mitigating the pandemic, maintaining immunization program performance is a critical issue to prevent further outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Routine immunization programs should be reinstated as soon as conditions stabilize, and may be the major indication of a rehabilitating health system in a post-crisis context. To support the rehabilitation process, well-developed communication strategies and approaches are required to inform stakeholders, and the broader society about the potential impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and specific mitigation strategies on the continuity and performance of the immunization program.\r\nIn Indonesia, all children receive routine immunization services in public health facilities, free of charge. Immunization services for school children are centrally funded and conducted through the school-based immunization program, where regional health center staffs deliver vaccines in local schools [2]. As a part of this program, measles, diphtheria, and tetanus vaccines are administered to pupils in the first grade of elementary school, while tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine is administered to those in the second and fifth grades of elementary school. Through strong commitment from central and local governments, approximately 15 million children are targeted to be immunized every year [3]. This annual program is usually started in August in all schools. This successful program has been appreciated by WHO because of its high coverage, acceptance by parents, efficiency, and protective levels [3]. In particular, the wastage rate is reported to be low (<20%) and declining trends of measles, diphtheria, and tetanus incidences are evident [3]. The enrollment rate in this program is also reported to be relatively high (>90%), which is better than, for instance, in Malaysia (85%), the neighboring country [4]. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic and drop-out could potentially affect the immunization program this year. Due to the current pandemic, the government has decided to close all schools in the country starting 16 March 2020. The duration of school closures will be reviewed periodically, depending on the development of the COVID-19 situation.\r\nDespite the economic growth and the escalated number of investments in the health-care sector, Indonesia remains one of the countries with relevant but declining numbers of under-vaccinated children [5]. In the recent years, national immunization coverage had been steadily increasing, but currently appears to be declining [6]. The latest Indonesian Basic Health Survey reported that the proportion of fully immunized children in the age of 12\xe2\x80\x9323\xc2\xa0months old was only 58%, which was lower than the targeted national coverage by the government (93%) [6]. As the most populous island, the proportion of fully immunized children in Java was reported to be 67% (see Figure 1) [6]. \r\nFigure 1.  Basic childhood immunization coverage (12\xe2\x80\x9323\xc2\xa0months of age).\r\nFigure 1.  Basic childhood immunization coverage (12\xe2\x80\x9323\xc2\xa0months of age).\r\nThe current pandemic will likely further enhance variability between location, local priorities, and economic differences. The concept of an urban-rural divide is a key determinant for immunization success in Indonesia. Although the majority of the population lives in urban areas, 63% of all unvaccinated children live in rural areas, posing specific challenges [7]. In these sub-national variabilities, geographic and logistic challenges as well as local government priorities are critical factors. In the context of decentralization, district governments are responsible for service delivery, such as the operational costs of facilities, health worker incentives, cold chain, and other supporting activities. In many districts, potential lack of commitment, comprehensive planning, and budget execution capacity are strongly correlated with low contributions of local governments to support the immunization program\xe2\x80\x99s activities. In addition, the wealthy and the well-educated are more likely to complete their vaccinations, even in urban areas where everyone has a near equal chance of having or reinitiating contact with the immunization services. Immunization rates are higher in the wealthiest quintile, compared with the poorest quintile [6]. The COVID-19 pandemic aggravates the challenge to deal with those already existing problems.\r\nObviously, the COVID-19 pandemic is a disruptive event that causes severe social, economic, and political stress. We analyzed several scenarios for reductions in immunization coverage as compared to the situation before the pandemic. Specifically, we estimated the impact of the pandemic in reducing the basic childhood immunization coverage by immunization coverage reductions in each province by 5%, 10%, and 20% in respective scenarios. Since Java is the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic with approximately 82% of total confirmed cases and 70% of total deaths in Indonesia [8], we assumed the impact of the pandemic in reducing immunization coverage would be doubled in all provinces of Java. We estimated the basic childhood immunization coverage would be 53%, 50%, and 43% for the respective scenarios of immunization coverage reductions at 5%, 10%, and 20% (see Table 1). Reductions can be assumed to be related to school closures, whereas health-care centers may now present as an alternative option. Yet, vaccine hesitancy may present a next obstacle. \r\nTable 1.  The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on basic childhood immunization coverage.\r\nThe experience of the diphtheria outbreak in Indonesia in 2017 showed that low vaccination coverage was associated with the lack of access to immunization services, the lack of awareness about the benefits of vaccination, and vaccine hesitancy [9]. A recent study on parents\xe2\x80\x99 hesitancy toward vaccination in Aceh and West Sumatera, Indonesia highlighted that the majority of respondents would not want their children to get vaccinated [10]. Now on top of that, parents worry to go to health-care centers because of scare for COVID-19 infection. A study by Santoli et al. indicated a significant decrease on the coverage of non-influenza childhood vaccines in the USA because parents are concerned about taking their children to the general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic [11].\r\nTo maintain immunization rates in this pandemic situation with school closures, central and local governments are urged to establish mitigation programs to ascertain that immunization services will remain fully accessible through health-care centers. It is well known that decision-making processes regarding vaccination are complex and this process tends to be more complicated and multidimensional in a pandemic situation [9]. Therefore, well-designed campaigns should be applied to minimize perceived barriers and increase expectations regarding vaccine accessibility, efficacy, and pandemic interventions, such as practice good hygiene and physical distancing, at the same time. In the context of Indonesia, these campaigns should be integrated adequately within the most trusted sectors of society, i.e. religion and healthcare, with critical roles played by trusted individuals in the vaccination delivery programs and religious leaderships [9].\r\nThe pandemic is profoundly affecting the countries\xe2\x80\x99 economic growth, but the depth and duration of the shock are unusually uncertain. The World Bank estimated that the economy in Indonesia is projected to decline by 2.1\xe2\x80\x933.5% in 2020, coming from an increase of 5.0% in 2019 [12]. In addition, as a middle-income country, Indonesia is designated to explore internal co-financing of vaccines since financial assistances have been gradually phased out. With economic decline and the country\xe2\x80\x99s started transition to fully self-financing its immunization program in 2019, Indonesia needs to find extra sources of new resources to replace about 10\xe2\x80\x9315% externally financed share of the immunization program budget [7]. In addition, as a highly decentralized country, local governments frequently fail to properly execute their resource allocation of the entire health-care budget, whereas the central government has limited ability to influence how resources are allocated at the district level where delivery is done. This also further enhances noted high variability in outputs and outcomes in immunization persists. Such organization of financing sources for the immunization program may threaten its performance also due to the danger of resulting complexity in understanding roles and responsibilities between central and local governments.\r\nNext to maintaining immunization performance, the central government is now struggling to warrant the immunization budget as a result of the pandemic impact. It should be highlighted that the immunization budget in Indonesia is not determined by forecasting needs, but by the level of acceptance of the Ministry of National Development Planning to fit the needs of the healthcare system into the Ministry of Finance\xe2\x80\x99s assigned ceiling. Up to now, Indonesia has not yet applied significant efforts to create new potential revenue-generating strategies. An option of taxing on socially harmful goods, such as tobacco and alcohol, has not yet been considered by the government to finance the health-care programs, including immunization. As of yet, Indonesia has rather expressed strong interest in resource tracking and efficiency gains rather than a push for revenue generation. Again, this focus potentially endangers the financial sustainability of the immunization program in Indonesia. Both mitigating the pandemic and maintaining the coverage and success of the immunization program should reflect integrated efforts to control infection spread and reduce the illness attack rate. To be financed over the medium and long term in an uncertain economy, this integrated effort should be considered as an investment in Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s future rather than a cost burden. A realistic approach to expand fiscal space is needed through efficiency gains both in other public sectors and the health-care sector itself, inclusive immunization, and through new innovative interventions and investments for generating revenues.\r\nTable 1.

A multi-institutional study suggests that prioritizing vaccine delivery to older age groups and the medically vulnerable has the greatest impact in minimizing loss of life. Strategic vaccine delivery is critical to reducing COVID-19 transmission, mortality and long-term health impacts affirm a study published in PLOS Computational Biology by Sam Moore, Matt Keeling and colleagues at the University of Warwick, United Kingdom. While older people are more likely to experience serious health outcomes related to COVID-19 infections, younger age groups contribute significantly to disease transmission and spread.\r\nAlso Read:\xc2\xa0COVID-19 Vaccine FAQs: Should Women Avoid COVID Vaccine During Periods? How To Use A Pulse Oximeter?\r\nIn order to test the efficacy of different vaccination strategies on minimizing deaths and hospitalisations, researchers built an age-structured model that simulated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within different regions in the United Kingdom. The authors then used the model to test multiple different scenarios, including variations in vaccine efficacy using observational data on comorbidities and social-distancing measures in the United Kingdom. The models showed that vaccine strategies prioritizing older age groups first most effectively mitigated deaths and lost quality of life years, despite the significant role of younger groups in disease spread.\r\nAlso Read:\xc2\xa0COVID Vaccination: Dos And Don\xe2\x80\x99ts To Remember As Vaccines Rollout For All Adults From May 1\r\nSince the study\xe2\x80\x99s completion in 2020, data has become available for the key assumption on vaccine uptake and specific vaccine characteristics, however, the general conclusions of the study remain relevant.\r\nAdditionally, the research has already helped guide UK policymakers in the development of an effective COVID-19 vaccination program, including the formation of the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation\xe2\x80\x99s priority groups that have been used for vaccine delivery.\r\nAlso Read: No Serious Side-Effect Attached To COVID-19 Vaccines: Director-General Of Health Services\r\nAccording to the authors, \xe2\x80\x9cWhile the ultimate success of any vaccination scheme will be highly contingent on the characteristics of the vaccine itself and the level of population uptake, as vaccines are developed which mitigate the disease, it is of great importance that they are delivered in an optimal manner \xe2\x80\x94 reducing mortality and healthcare demands.

Chronic pain has been defined as pain that persists or recurs for longer than 3 months, and it exerts an enormous personal and economic burden, affecting more than 30% of people worldwide. Even controlling for higher rates of depression, suicide, and opioid use, chronic pain is associated with a lower life expectancy.   The biopsychosocial model views pain as the denouement of a dynamic interaction among biological, psychological, and social factors. Indiscriminately prescribing medications and doing procedures based simply on a diagnosis or on symptoms will unnecessarily increase the risk:benefit ratio of therapy.

Led by an international collaboration of experts, this Commission looks at progress over the past decades and emerging challenges for RMNCAH in China. It proposes a strategic framework to achieve RMNCAH-related targets for the SDGs and Healthy China 2030 that encompasses four essential drivers: financing, workforce development, medicine and technology, and information technology systems. The recommendations proposed by the Commission are essential to improve access, equity, and quality of RMNCAH services, to build a healthy and friendly environment for every woman, child, and adolescent domestically, and improve global governance in RMNCAH.\r\nDespite being responsible for causing 35% of deaths in women each year, cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women remains understudied, under-recognised, under-diagnosed, and under-treated, with women under-represented in clinical trials. To tackle these inequities, 17 experts from 11 countries have authored the first-ever global report on CVD in women. The all -female-led Commission outlines 10 ambitious new recommendations to tackle inequities intargeting diagnosis, treatment, and prevention to reduce CVD in women, including educating health care providers and patients on early detection to prevent heart disease in women; scaling up heart health programs in highly populated and underdeveloped regions; and prioritising sex-specific research on heart disease in women and intervention strategies for women.\r\nThe Lancet sets extremely high standards.

Here, we investigate the expected outcomes of the interplay between vaccination rollout and adaptive mitigation measures constantly altering the epidemic trajectory and keeping the reproduction number around the unit. Using a novel mathematical modeling framework, we estimate that, for vaccination capacities of at least 4 daily doses administered per 1,000 inhabitants, a complete release of mitigation measures can be expected within 7 to 13 months since the start of vaccination, with a two-year cumulative incidence of deaths between 0.18 and 0.46 per 1,000 population. A heavier burden of deaths and a delayed \xe2\x80\x9creturn-to-normal\xe2\x80\x9d is expected for lower vaccine capacities, if viral transmissibility exceeds by >60% the one estimated at the beginning of the pandemic, or if vaccine protection is short-lived. Failure to prioritize the elderly or a premature release of mitigation measures after vaccination of the most fragile will conspicuously increase the expected mortality. Finally, strategies oriented to prioritize the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 by maintaining strict restrictions will take a similar time as a mitigation approach, possibly resulting in acceptability issues. Persisting unknowns about the evolving epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 variants and on the effectiveness of available and upcoming vaccines may warrant a future reassessment of these conclusions.\r\nSince December 2020, vaccinations against COVID-19 are being rolled out in many countries of the world, in a race to put an end to a pandemic that has caused millions of lives lost [1], devastating economic effects [2], and a tremendous impact on mental health [3]. Limitations in the supply of COVID-19 vaccines and in the logistics of rollout imply that several months will elapse before immunization campaigns can have a significant impact [4]. Meanwhile, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) will remain the main tool to maintain control of the epidemic. While China and a few other countries in South-East Asia and Oceania have successfully pursued a zero-COVID policy [5] with suppression of transmission via aggressive localized lockdown policies and strict border control, most countries in the world resorted to mitigation strategies [6], adjusting physical distancing restrictions (PDRs) in the attempt to balance a low level of viral circulation with individual freedoms and economic losses. In practice, this balance is not always achieved as desired, resulting in an alternance between periods of constant or declining circulation and new resurgences, to which correspond phases of relaxation and intensification of PDRs. Projecting the impact of vaccination under unstable conditions is complex and most approaches today have assumed constant restrictions and various degrees of epidemic severity while vaccination is implemented [4, 7-10]. Here, we propose a different approach by simulating the effect of a vaccine rollout under perfect mitigation, i.e., assuming that governments will be capable to maintain an approximately constant incidence by adjusting PDRs as immunity accumulates.\r\nWe developed a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, structured by age and accounting for age-specific susceptibility, contacts, and prevalence of comorbidities. Incidence is maintained approximately constant over time during vaccine rollout by continuously recalibrating a scaling factor, roughly representing the proportion of pre-pandemic contacts allowed by the existing PDRs (see Appendix). As population immunity accrues due to natural infection and vaccination, the proportion of allowed contacts will increase until all pre-pandemic contacts are eventually resumed, representing the process of PDRs relaxation.\r\nThe impact of vaccination is quantified in terms of cumulative deaths and of the relaxation of PDRs. The latter is reported as the percent increase in allowed contacts, with 0% representing restrictions needed to have a constant incidence at the start of the vaccination program, and 100% representing complete reopening. Additionally, we estimate the time to \xe2\x80\x9czero-COVID\xe2\x80\x9d defined as no reported cases for at least two consecutive weeks; by zero-COVID we refer to a situation similar to the one achieved by countries in Asia and Oceania, where no cases are usually detected but local flare-ups may occur due to importation of cases (e.g., outbreaks in under-vaccinated communities). We take Italy as a case study and simulate the process over a time horizon of two years.\r\nAs a baseline, we consider a two-dose vaccination campaign under the following assumptions: i) an incidence of reported cases maintained at about 50 cases per week per 100,000 population; ii) a vaccination coverage of 75%; iii) a daily capacity of 4 doses per 1,000 population; iv) prioritization based on the WHO SAGE roadmap [11] (Appendix); v) vaccines prevent infection; vi) protection is long-lasting (> 2 years); vii) vaccine is administered independently of a previous COVID-19 infection. These assumptions are then modified in a number of alternative scenarios and sensitivity analyses.\r\nIn the absence of vaccination and under mitigation measures, we estimate 1.68 cumulative COVID-19 deaths per 1,000 population (95%CI: 0.95-2.79), occurring uniformly over the two years (Figure 1A). The natural immunity achieved by viral circulation allows a limited relaxation of PDRs, estimated between 20 and 30% in the fourth semester (Figure 1B), with a large residual potential for new epidemic waves: the effective reproduction number at the end of simulations is estimated at 1.4-1.6 (Appendix). These results suggest that in the absence of vaccination, the only viable way to control COVID-19 infections would be to maintain strict PDRs in the very long term.\r\nA) Estimated incidence of deaths within each of the four simulated semesters. B) Average amount of PDRs relaxation over each semester. Bars indicate the mean and vertical lines the 95% projection interval. C) overall comparison using the cumulative incidence of deaths and the average relaxation of PDRs over the two simulated years. Individual stochastic simulations are shown as points, the mean of their bivariate distribution as crosses and its 75-percentile as closed curves.\r\nIn the baseline scenario, the vaccination campaign is expected to be completed after about 13 months. Vaccination can limit cumulative deaths to 0.36 per 1,000 (95%CI: 0.21-0.59), i.e., almost 80% less than in absence of vaccination (Figure 1A). In addition, PDRs might be completely relaxed by month 12, with most of the relaxation occurring rapidly over the second semester (Figure 1B), and zero-COVID might be achieved after about 18 months (95%CI: 17-20).\r\nThe effect of a vaccination campaign may depend on several factors. Some of these depend on organizational and public health choices, e.g., how fast available vaccine doses are administered, or which population segments are prioritized. A halved vaccination capacity (2 daily doses per 1,000 population) would imply a completion of the program after over 2 years, with continued circulation after that date. In addition, it would result in a higher mortality compared to the baseline (0.63 per 1,000; 95%CI: 0.36-1.03) and in a slower relaxation of PDRs, which is expected to be complete by month 21 (95%CI: 19-22, Figure 2A). Vaccination capacities higher than the baseline would have a limited impact on the burden of deaths, but they would allow a quicker relaxation of PDRs, reaching complete reopening at month 9 and 8 for vaccination capacities of 6 and 8 daily doses per 1,000 population, respectively. Simulations of alternative prioritizations (details in Appendix) suggest that targeting population segments with highest contact rates may allow a more rapid relaxation of PDRs (3 to 5 months earlier than the baseline when prioritizing schoolchildren, but only 1 month earlier when prioritizing working-age adults), at the cost of a two- to three-fold mortality burden compared to the baseline (Figure 2B).\r\nA) vaccination capacities; B) vaccine prioritizations (details in Appendix); C: vaccine coverages; D) duration of vaccine protection. Top panels show the estimated incidence of deaths within each of the four simulated semesters. Middle panels show the average amount of PDRs relaxation over each semester. Bars indicate the mean and vertical lines the 95% projection interval. Bottom panels compare scenarios using the cumulative incidence of deaths and the average relaxation of PDRs over the two simulated years. Individual stochastic simulations are shown as points, the mean of their bivariate distribution as crosses and its 75-percentile as closed curves.\r\nThe population\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to receive the vaccine is represented by the achievable coverage. A 60% coverage would anticipate the relaxation of PDRs by switching earlier from high-risk to high-transmission population segments, but it would result in about 0.46 cumulative deaths per 1,000 population (95%CI: 0.26-0.79) in two years (Figure 2C). Conversely, an increased coverage to 90% would not significantly reduce the mortality burden, but it would delay the complete relaxation of PDRs by about 1.5 months compared to the baseline.\r\nOne of the main unknowns on vaccine performance is the duration of vaccine protection. When assuming that protection wanes on average 1 year or 6 months after administration, in absence of a re-vaccination campaign we estimate a steep resurgence of deaths starting from the third semester, and the need to reinstate stricter PDRs during the fourth semester to counter the rising reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 driven by the refueling of the susceptible reservoir. In these scenarios, we estimate 1.34-1.57 deaths per 1,000 population (with a wide uncertainty ranging from 0.63 to 2.56 per 1,000, Figure 2D) in two years. We note however that the end of the vaccination campaign around month 13 in the baseline scenario implies that even with a short duration of vaccine protection, re-vaccination is feasible before the deterioration of the epidemiological situation, if vaccine stockpiles/supplies are sufficient.\r\nAnother major uncertainty in the evolving SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is the emergence of viral lineages with increased transmissibility [12-14]. We tested the effect of vaccine rollout assuming a transmissibility that is 20% to 80% higher than what estimated initially for SARS-CoV-2. In such case, we expect a possibly substantial increase in total deaths by up to 140% higher for transmissibility increased by 80% (Figure 3A) and by up to 290% when considering also a higher lethality of the variants [15-16] (Appendix). Zero-COVID is generally not achieved in two years unless the increase in transmissibility remains below 20%. PDRs will have to be intensified in the first semester compared to the baseline (represented in Figure 3A by negative values), maintaining levels similar to the baseline\xe2\x80\x99s initial ones throughout the second semester; however, the complete relaxation is expected within month 14 (95%CI 13-15) even with a transmissibility increased by 60%. Only in the worst case we expect a complete reopening later than month 17.\r\nA) increased transmissibility; B) limits to PDR relaxations to suppress transmission; C) complete reopening after immunization of the most fragile. Top panels show the estimated incidence of deaths within each of the four simulated semesters. Middle panels show the average amount of PDRs relaxation over each semester. Bars indicate the mean and vertical lines the 95% projection interval. Bottom panels compare scenarios using the cumulative incidence of deaths and the average relaxation of PDRs over the two simulated years. Individual stochastic simulations are shown as points, the mean of their bivariate distribution as crosses and its 75-percentile as closed curves.\r\nWe evaluated the sensitivity of model outputs with respect to several other variables (Appendix). When allowing incidence levels higher than 50 weekly cases per 100,000, the accumulation of immunity from natural infections speeds up the relaxation of PDRs but the death burden increases proportionally. When considering a vaccine efficacy reduced by 15%, we found up to 50% more deaths, with minimal impact on the time to complete relaxation of PDRs. If the vaccine provides protection against disease, but not against infection, we expect a doubled number of deaths at the end of the two years, and PDRs would not be relaxed by more than 40%. A homogeneous susceptibility to infection (rather than reduced in children and increased in older adults [17-18]) would reduce deaths by 40%. Finally, model results were substantially insensitive to uncertainties in the value of initial immunity.\r\nGovernments may choose to use the population immunity conferred by vaccines to achieve zero-COVID sooner by not lifting PDRs until it is safe to do so without the risk of new resurgences. Mixed strategies may also be adopted where PDRs are lifted up to a certain point, and then priority is given to suppression. When no relaxation of PDRs is allowed since the start of vaccination, zero-COVID would be anticipated at month 12 since vaccination start (95%CI: 10-13, Figure 3B), after which a complete reopening could be safe due to the below-threshold transmission potential (Appendix). We estimate a cumulative incidence of 0.18 deaths per 1,000 population (95%CI: 0.11-0.30) for this scenario, roughly half than the baseline. When allowing a 25%, 50% or 75% relaxation of PDRs before aiming for suppression, zero-COVID would occur on month 14, 16 and 17, and the resulting cumulative incidence of deaths would be 0.28 (0.17-0.46), 0.33 (0.19-0.54) and 0.35 (0.20-0.58) per 1,000 (Figure 3B).\r\nAn opposite strategy might be to maintain mitigation measures until the most fragile population segments (individuals above 60 years of age or with comorbidities) are protected. After this milestone, occurring around month 6 since vaccination start under baseline assumptions, all PDRs are completely removed. Despite the protection of the high-risk population, a high incidence of cumulative deaths is expected (1.14 per 1,000, 95%CI: 0.70-1.63, Figure 3C), due to a large epidemic wave that would occur following the premature dismission of mitigation measures.\r\nA summary comparison of key results for all considered scenarios is represented in Figure 4.\r\nRed circles show the mean estimated mortality burden over the two years with shaded areas representing the 95% projection intervals. Bars show the mean time to zero-COVID and horizontal lines the 95% projection interval. Fading bars indicate no zero-COVID on average within 24 months; for scenarios with 60% coverage and 20% increased transmissibility, about 30% and 93% of simulations are expected to result in zero-COVID before month 24 respectively (dashed horizontal lines). Vertical lines indicate the end of vaccination programs (fixed, given capacity and coverage). A dashed vertical line indicate completion after 24 months. Blue points and horizontal blue lines indicate the mean and 95% projection interval for the time at which a complete relaxation of PDRs is reached. For scenarios with limited relaxations of PDRs, blue lines are not shown because complete relaxation occurs when zero-COVID is achieved.\r\nWe examined the effect of COVID-19 vaccination programs in countries which were not able, to date, to suppress circulation of the virus. Under the assumption that existing vaccines confer protection from infection (rather than just disease) and that immunity is long-lived (>2 years), the combination of vaccine roll-out and effective mitigation strategies is expected to prevent a large proportion of deaths while at the same time allowing a progressive lifting of physical distancing restrictions. A complete return to a pre-pandemic lifestyle can be expected between 7 and 15 months since the start of vaccination in most scenarios (Figure 4), provided that a vaccination capacity of at least 4 doses per 1,000 population per day is achieved. Zero-COVID, i.e., suppression of transmission similar to the one observed in some Asian and Oceanian countries, would occur approximately 6 months thereafter. Higher capacities are not expected to produce major reductions in the number of deaths but will help release restrictions more rapidly. Another critical parameter will be the duration of vaccine-induced protection: if vaccine protection will last 1 year or less on average, re-vaccination must be deployed as soon as the primary campaign is over (13 months since its start in the baseline case); otherwise, the relaxation of PDRs will need to be reversed at some point, and the number of deaths will rise dramatically. We also explored the impact of more transmissible variants [12-14]: stricter mitigation measures than those existing in many countries in December 2020 are required throughout at least the first semester, but the timing to complete reopening should remain within 15 months as long as the increase in transmissibility does not exceed 60% compared to historical lineages. In any case, the additional transmissibility will result in a much larger number of lives lost (up to four-fold the baseline value if variants are also more lethal [15-16]).\r\nWe also evaluated the possibility that countries will relax PDRs only up to a certain point, using the buildup of population immunity to pursue suppression of transmission. In the case that no relaxation of PDRs is allowed, zero-COVID can be obtained in about 12 months, after which the transmission potential will have fallen below the epidemic threshold and a complete reopening may be allowed. This suppression-oriented approach requires a similar time until complete reopening than the mitigation approach with a halved burden of deaths. However, the tradeoff here is the need to maintain restrictions for a long period, with negative effects on the economy and population\xe2\x80\x99s mental health and likely acceptability issues for the public, faced with a steadily declining incidence. On the opposite, pressures to reopen society may be expected after the daily incidence of deaths will have dropped to low values due to the vaccination of the most fragile. We show that if social contacts are completely resumed after the vaccination of fragile individuals is completed (about 6 months into the vaccination program), a major epidemic is to be expected with a large death toll.\r\nThere are a number of limitations that must be kept in mind when interpreting our results. First, we did not explicitly model which PDRs are relaxed as vaccination progresses; instead, we assumed a generic relaxation of measures that impacts all ages proportionally. The age-specific effect of relaxing existing PDRs is extremely hard to quantify, and their prioritization is a peculiarly political decision, depending on the governments\xe2\x80\x99 strategic interests. Second, we assume mitigation measures to maintain an approximately constant incidence; although this dynamic is clearly idealized, we consider this an acceptable approximation of the fluctuating incidence observed in most countries. We anticipate that possible resurgences due to imperfect mitigation will contribute to speed up the population immunity and therefore the relaxation of PDRs, however at the cost of more lives lost. Third, we did not explicitly model the effect of other possible features of emerging variants, such as reductions in vaccine effectiveness [19-20] or the ability to escape natural immunity [13, 21-22], or a combination of them. We estimate that a 15% lower efficacy of vaccines under the transmissibility of historical lineages would imply an increase in deaths of up to 50%, without affecting the time to a complete relaxation of PDRs. The possibility of escape from natural immunity is not expected to be a major driver of our conclusions, considering the limited share of population immunity due to natural infection even in scenarios without vaccination (up to 30% at the end of the two years) and to the fact that vaccination is administered independently of a previous COVID-19 infection [23]. Similar considerations apply to the possibility that immunity from natural infection wanes over time [24].\r\nFourth, we assume that vaccines will protect from infection. This seems to be the case for at least some of the licensed vaccines, according to recent studies [25-27]; however, it needs to be further confirmed also for other vaccines under approval and with respect to circulating variants. In the unlikely case that vaccines only avoid symptomatic disease with no reduction on susceptibility nor infectiousness, our simulations suggest dramatically different results, especially in terms of the ability of countries to relax PDRs. Fifth, we did not consider possible changes in viral transmissibility due to seasonality, such as the closure of schools or the larger amount of time spent outdoors during the summer. This may help reduce deaths and expand the margins for reopening during the summer.\r\nFinally, we assumed that vaccination for children under 16 years old will be available before month 11, when the program is scheduled to be extended to school-aged children in the majority of scenarios. Although there are no licensed pediatric vaccines against COVID-19 yet, several manufacturers have already started phase 2/3 trials for children as young as 3 years old [28]. Therefore, the expectation of having an effective vaccine in the second half of the year is not unrealistic.\r\nThere are still many uncertainties on characteristics of vaccines and on the evolving epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. However, we show that vaccination programs under mitigation scenarios may allow a return to normal within one year since their start if a sufficient capacity and coverage is achieved. The epidemiological characteristics of emerging variants, especially with respect to their increased transmissibility and the effectiveness of vaccines, will need to be closely monitored to promptly reassess these conclusions as more evidence will become available.\r\nData used in the manuscript are publicly available.\r\nM.A. has received research funding from Seqirus.

Routine childhood immunization may be adversely affected by COVID-19 mitigation measures. We aimed to identify the prevalence of delayed immunization and explore the reasons and barriers for delayed immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online self-administered questionnaire for parents of children under two years of age during the period from 1 May to 30 June 2020. Most of the 749 participants (82.6%) were mothers, with 31 to 40 years being the most common age group (49.8%). Nearly three-quarters (73.2%) of the parents had appointments scheduled for their child\xe2\x80\x99s vaccination during the pandemic, and approximately 23.4% of the parents reported a delay of more than one month in the immunization of their child. The most common reason for the delay was the fear of being infected by COVID-19 (60.9%). Large household size and lack of insurance were risk factors for immunization delay. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the timeliness of routine childhood immunization in Saudi Arabia. Childhood immunization should be prioritized, as well as the implementation of focused strategies to achieve significant and sustainable vaccination rates during pandemics.\r\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a threat to public health and healthcare systems worldwide [1]; prompting governments to implement numerous interventions such as curfews, extensive screening measures and travel bans to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 [2]. School closure has been a vital intervention strategy to curb community transmission during the pandemic [3,4]. Although these strategies are crucial, concerns have arisen regarding lengthy school closures and home quarantine, which may negatively impact children\xe2\x80\x99s mental and physical health [2,5]. Furthermore, disruptions to healthcare services may result in childhood immunization being missed or delayed, which is a significant concern [6,7]. Vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) remains an important issue that requires adherence to recommendations to prevent severe illness in children [8]. Delayed or missed vaccination makes children susceptible to certain preventable diseases and may also affect herd immunity [9]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), VPD is a threat to 80 million children worldwide because of the disruption of healthcare systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic [10]. In addition, vaccination against influenza may help decrease the severity of disease in patients who experience co-morbid COVID-19 and influenza infections [11,12].\r\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of deferred vaccinations varied across countries. For instance, only 25% of children received vaccinations timeously in the United States [12,13]. In Saudi Arabia, the delay of vaccinations ranged from 9% to 24% due to various factors, such as unavailability of the vaccine in some primary healthcare facilities and traveling when vaccination was due [14,15].\r\nAdministering vaccinations in a timely manner is crucial but may be affected by various factors. Natural disasters, for example, may have a negative impact on vaccination rates and timeliness, leading to infectious disease outbreaks [6,16]. Thus, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding the disruption of childhood immunization to prevent VPD outbreaks [17]. The Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) also recommends that childhood vaccinations should be given timeously during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nTo date, there are few reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on childhood immunization. In this study, we aimed to identify the prevalence of delayed vaccinations and uncover the reasons and barriers for delayed immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate delays in childhood vaccinations. The findings of our research will be pertinent to recognizing the obstacles to vaccination timeliness during public health emergencies and thereby aid in the implementation of strategies at the national level for pandemic preparedness.\r\nA descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire comprising 25 questions. The questionnaire was designed to measure the prevalence of, and reasons for, delays in childhood vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The study population included parents from different cities of the Qassim region who had a child under two years of age during the period from 1 March to 30 June 2020. Parents who did not have children below the age of two were excluded. We conducted a nonprobability convenience sampling of parents via the WhatsApp application using the Google platform between 1 May and 30 June. We chose 12 medical students to distribute the questionnaire and collect data from parents in different cities in Qassim. The participants gave consent before commencing the questionnaire.\r\nThe Qassim region is located in the center of Saudi Arabia and has a population of approximately 1.5 million, of which 80.4% are Saudi citizens. The national childhood immunization schedule targets 16 VPDs at various stages, beginning at birth and subsequently at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. The vaccines are for hepatitis B, diphtheria\xe2\x80\x93tetanus\xe2\x80\x93pertussis, polio, Hemophilus influenzae type B, rotavirus, pneumococcal infections, bacillus Calmette\xe2\x80\x93Gu\xc3\xa9rin (BCG), hepatitis A, measles, varicella, meningococcal infections, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and human papillomavirus (HPV).\r\nThe questionnaire was validated in two steps. Initially, it was reviewed by three academic experts in the field to evaluate the quality and bias in the survey. Then, the questionnaire was pretested on 20 parents who were subsequently excluded from the current analysis. Minor language modification was performed based on expert suggestions. The survey was conducted in Arabic for the participants.\r\nThe questionnaire comprised four sections: parents\xe2\x80\x99 demographic data; current immunization status and attitude toward immunization delay; immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic; and possible reasons that prevented parents from vaccinating their child or children.\r\nVaccination delay was defined as vaccinations that took place one month or more after the designated time.\r\nParents\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly disagree\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly agree\xe2\x80\x9d. Responses such as \xe2\x80\x9cagree\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly agree\xe2\x80\x9d were coded with 1 point. Responses such as \xe2\x80\x9cneutral,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdisagree,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly disagree\xe2\x80\x9d were coded with 0 points. A negative question was included and reverse-coded to avoid bias. The overall score of attitudes was calculated by summing the scores of the 3 questions. The attitude score range was from 0 to 3 points, which indicated that the higher the score, the more positive the attitude toward the timeliness of vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. By using a score of 2 as the cutoff point to determine the level of attitude, parents were classified as having a negative attitude if the score was from 0 to 1 point, and as having a positive attitude if the score was from 2 to 3 points.\r\nData were summarized with numerical values, percentages, means and standard deviation whenever appropriate. For comparisons, a Mann\xe2\x80\x93Whitney U test or a Kruskal\xe2\x80\x93Wallis test was applied. Normality, statistical interactions and collinearity (i.e., variance inflation factor) were also assessed using Kolmogorov\xe2\x80\x93Smirnov and Shapiro\xe2\x80\x93Wilk tests. The relationship between length of delay in childhood vaccination, consistent, timely childhood vaccinations and preferred vaccination locale during the pandemic was calculated using a chi-squared test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant for all statistical tests. All data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0.\r\nApproval from the Qassim regional research ethics committee was granted (IRB# H-04-Q-001).\r\nIn total, 802 parents were invited to participate in the study, and 53 participants were excluded due to incomplete questionnaires. We included 749 participants in the analysis, as shown in Table 1. Mothers were predominantly higher in number (82.6%) than fathers (17.4%), with 31 to 40 years being the most common age group (49.8%). Most parents obtained a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree (78.4%). Findings showed that 9.9% of the participants were working in the medical field. Furthermore, 38.9% reported having one child. Nearly all participants (93.5%) stated that they currently had one child under two years.\r\nSociodemographic characteristics of parents (n = 749).\r\nSAR\xe2\x80\x94Saudi riyal; PHC\xe2\x80\x94primary healthcare center.\r\nIn assessing awareness of COVID-19 risk in children, our findings showed that the proportion of parents who believed \xe2\x80\x9cchildren could be infected with COVID-19\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cchildren can transmit COVID-19\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCOVID-19 illness in children can lead to child hospitalization\xe2\x80\x9d were 73.2%, 74.2% and 73.4%, respectively.\r\nThe parents\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes regarding the timeliness of childhood vaccination showed that the proportion of parents who \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly agreed\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the statement \xe2\x80\x9cvaccinations are essential to keep children healthy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvaccinations should be given at the scheduled time\xe2\x80\x9d were 73.6% and 53.9%, respectively. Conversely, the proportion of parents who \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly agreed\xe2\x80\x9d regarding the statement \xe2\x80\x9cvaccination delay is not a problem as you give all vaccines regardless of the due time for your child\xe2\x80\x9d was low, with only 6.3%. Based on these three attitude statements, the mean attitude score was 2.25 (SD = 0.73), with nearly all parents (90%) classified as having a positive attitude, while the rest (10%) were classified as negative. When comparing the attitude score versus the sociodemographic characteristics of parents, it was observed that parents with one child were significantly more likely to have better attitudes than those with two or more children (F = 2.712; p = 0.006), as shown in Table 2.\r\nAssessment of parents\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes concerning childhood vaccination timeliness during COVID-19 (n = 749).\r\nSA\xe2\x80\x94strongly agree; A\xe2\x80\x94agree; N; neutral; D\xe2\x80\x94disagree; SD\xe2\x80\x94strongly disagree.\r\nOverall, 73.2% of the parents had appointments scheduled for their child\xe2\x80\x99s vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, approximately 47.8% of the parents reported a delay of more than two weeks in the immunization of their child. A significant delay of more than one month was observed in 23.4% of the cases. However, 52.2% reported that the scheduled vaccine was given on time or within two weeks of the due date. Almost 73% of the respondents were aware of the MOH recommendation. The most common source of information was social media sites (49.5%).\r\nOf those who had a child scheduled for immunization during the pandemic, 73% were aware of MOH recommendations for vaccinations. Nearly 70% of the parents received this information through social media, and 30% through TV or newspapers.

Other reasons mentioned by parents were traveling during the vaccination time, vaccine unavailability or closed clinics (6.7%).\r\nReasons for vaccination delays.\r\nWhen parents were asked about their preferred locale for vaccination, most of the parents preferred to vaccinate their children at home (36.6%) or at primary healthcare facilities dedicated to vaccination only (35.1%). However, only 17.8% reported that they would continue to obtain childhood vaccinations at hospitals or other healthcare centers as usual (see Figure 3).\r\nPreferred locale for child vaccination during the pandemic.\r\nTable 3 depicts the univariate and multivariate regression analyses to determine which factors were associated with delayed vaccination of more than one month among parents who had scheduled child vaccinations during the pandemic. Findings revealed that the chance of delaying vaccinations for participants in the 31\xe2\x80\x9340 years age group was twice as high as that of the 18\xe2\x80\x9330 years age group (p = 0.011); however, in the multivariate regression model, the results became insignificant. The univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that the chance of delayed vaccination for participants with multiple children was three times more likely than for those with only one child (p < 0.001). Additionally, participants with medical insurance were less likely to delay their children\xe2\x80\x99s vaccinations than those without medical insurance (p = 0.043).\r\nUnivariate and multivariate regression model for determining factors associated with delayed vaccination (more than one month) (n = 548).\r\nUOR\xe2\x80\x94unadjusted odds ratio; AOR\xe2\x80\x94adjusted odds ratio; CI\xe2\x80\x94confidence interval; SAR\xe2\x80\x94Saudi riyal. ** Significant at p < 0.05 level.\r\nThe present study assessed the prevalence of, and reasons for, delayed childhood vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the timeliness of childhood immunization in the Qassim region of Saudi Arabia. To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on childhood immunization in Saudi Arabia.\r\nSeveral reports have suggested that childhood vaccination has been affected by the pandemic. Abbas et al. suggested that the risk of death due to VPD outweighed the risk of death due to possibly contracting COVID-19 during clinic visits [18]. After the national emergency declaration in the USA, a reduction in routine vaccinations was observed, primarily in children older than one month [19]. Moreover, an almost 20% decline in MMR vaccination was observed in England. The hexavalent vaccination also decreased, although less significantly than that of MMR [20]. However, in Pakistan, a substantial reduction in immunization of 52% was reported during the lockdown period. Reports indicate that the outreach vaccination service was affected more than fixed center services [21]. In our study, parents reported an almost 24% vaccination delay in routine vaccination during the first three months of the pandemic. The results of previous reports are consistent with our findings. However, previous reports were dependent on vaccination prescriptions to measure the trend of vaccination. In our study, we relied on parental reports regarding vaccination delays.\r\nIn the current study, household size was a risk factor for vaccination delay, consistent with previous research confirming the association between larger household size and vaccination delay among children [15,22]. This may be due to an increase in parental tasks, causing parents to miss vaccinations as a result of being overwhelmed. Moreover, uninsured families were at risk of delayed vaccination. In Saudi Arabia, vaccination is provided free of charge for all families under the government\xe2\x80\x99s primary healthcare system. However, insured families also have access to care from the private sector as well as the government\xe2\x80\x99s primary healthcare system. On the other hand, two-thirds of the delayed vaccinations occurred among children aged 12 months and younger. This finding is inconsistent with a report from the USA, in which they targeted and promoted vaccination in younger age groups during the pandemic. Indeed, routine childhood immunization should be prioritized in younger children.\r\nThe study revealed that most parents had a positive attitude toward the importance of timely vaccinations. In contrast, a previous study in Saudi Arabia showed that 65% of parents were not concerned about vaccination delays. The difference in findings may be attributed to improved parental vaccination awareness through primary care providers, MOH and the media [14]. Prior international studies have found parental education to be significantly associated with a positive attitude toward different types of vaccinations [23,24].\r\nAs expected, the fear of contracting COVID-19 was the most common reason for vaccination delays. Further reasons included the unavailability of vaccination appointments due to the lockdown and resultant healthcare service limitations. This is consistent with findings indicating the potential causes of missed vaccinations during the pandemic in the USA [19]. Surprisingly, advice received from healthcare service providers was another reason given by the parents to delay vaccinations. This may be due to the ambiguity of immunization recommendations and initial stay-at-home orders at the onset of the pandemic. Due to the fear of COVID-19 infection, most families who delayed their child\xe2\x80\x99s vaccination preferred to get their child vaccinated at home or attended to by healthcare staff solely dedicated to administering vaccinations. In Saudi Arabia, there was a home vaccination program during the influenza season aimed at increasing influenza vaccine coverage [25]. Thus, implementing home vaccination during a pandemic should be considered to increase vaccination rates, particularly for high-risk children. Moreover, many healthcare service providers in the USA have allotted vaccination appointments exclusively to the mornings, while sick patients are scheduled for later in the day. Other practices request that families wait in their vehicles until the exam room is ready, thereby avoiding contact between families [19,26].\r\nWhile the findings of this study are significant, the study is not without limitations. Specifically, the study was conducted in a single region in Saudi Arabia that may not be representative of the entire population. Additionally, the measurement of attitude may be imprecise due to the limited number of questions. Moreover, this study may have introduced some recall bias, and the results may be influenced by subjectivity. Nevertheless, this study provides an important understanding of the overall picture regarding immunization delay in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic. Thus, the findings may be used as a reference for outlining strategies to improve routine vaccination program coverage during natural disasters and pandemics.\r\nWe identified that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the timeliness of routine childhood vaccinations in Saudi Arabia. The results of our study demonstrated numerous barriers to timeous immunization. We suggest that routine childhood vaccination be prioritized and focused strategies implemented to achieve a significant and sustainable increase in vaccinations during pandemics.\r\nWe wish to thank Abdullah Aljlajle, Amar Alsawyan, Reem Albatshan, Remah Alsuhaibani, Ahmed Alrashidi, Ohud Alfawzan, Haneen Almohaimeed, Bayan Alsaqaby, Abdulrahman Alturki, Mzoun Alotaibi, Waad Almutairi and Abdulaziz Almohaimeed for their help with the distribution of questionnaires.\r\nConceptualization, M.A.; methodology, M.A.; software, M.A., validation, A.A. formal analysis, M.A. investigation, A.A.; resources, A.A.; data curation, A.A.; writing\xe2\x80\x94original draft preparation, A.A. and M.A.; writing\xe2\x80\x94review and editing M.A.; visualization, A.A.; supervision, M.A.; project administration, M.A. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\r\nResearchers would like to thank the Deanship of Scientific Research, Qassim University for funding publication of this project.\r\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Center for\r\n                        Biotechnology Information,\r\n                 U.S. National Library of Medicine\r\n\r\n8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda\r\nMD, 20894\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\nShowing items related by title and subject\r\n\r\nShow Statistical Information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa9 \r\n            WHO\r\n         2020\r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: \r\nAs a country with the highest death toll due to COVID-19 in Southeast Asia [1], the rapidly escalating health crisis has prompted the government of Indonesia to provide against the worst scenario for the impact of this pandemic through pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Health crises and emergencies have been omnipresent and habitually unpredictable in duration and location. With increasing awareness of stakeholders and communities, responses to this pandemic situation should be more systematic and well-organized with adequate timing. Apart from mitigating the pandemic, maintaining immunization program performance is a critical issue to prevent further outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Routine immunization programs should be reinstated as soon as conditions stabilize, and may be the major indication of a rehabilitating health system in a post-crisis context. To support the rehabilitation process, well-developed communication strategies and approaches are required to inform stakeholders, and the broader society about the potential impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and specific mitigation strategies on the continuity and performance of the immunization program.\r\nIn Indonesia, all children receive routine immunization services in public health facilities, free of charge. Immunization services for school children are centrally funded and conducted through the school-based immunization program, where regional health center staffs deliver vaccines in local schools [2]. As a part of this program, measles, diphtheria, and tetanus vaccines are administered to pupils in the first grade of elementary school, while tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine is administered to those in the second and fifth grades of elementary school. Through strong commitment from central and local governments, approximately 15 million children are targeted to be immunized every year [3]. This annual program is usually started in August in all schools. This successful program has been appreciated by WHO because of its high coverage, acceptance by parents, efficiency, and protective levels [3]. In particular, the wastage rate is reported to be low (<20%) and declining trends of measles, diphtheria, and tetanus incidences are evident [3]. The enrollment rate in this program is also reported to be relatively high (>90%), which is better than, for instance, in Malaysia (85%), the neighboring country [4]. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic and drop-out could potentially affect the immunization program this year. Due to the current pandemic, the government has decided to close all schools in the country starting 16 March 2020. The duration of school closures will be reviewed periodically, depending on the development of the COVID-19 situation.\r\nDespite the economic growth and the escalated number of investments in the health-care sector, Indonesia remains one of the countries with relevant but declining numbers of under-vaccinated children [5]. In the recent years, national immunization coverage had been steadily increasing, but currently appears to be declining [6]. The latest Indonesian Basic Health Survey reported that the proportion of fully immunized children in the age of 12\xe2\x80\x9323\xc2\xa0months old was only 58%, which was lower than the targeted national coverage by the government (93%) [6]. As the most populous island, the proportion of fully immunized children in Java was reported to be 67% (see Figure 1) [6]. \r\nFigure 1.  Basic childhood immunization coverage (12\xe2\x80\x9323\xc2\xa0months of age).\r\nFigure 1.  Basic childhood immunization coverage (12\xe2\x80\x9323\xc2\xa0months of age).\r\nThe current pandemic will likely further enhance variability between location, local priorities, and economic differences. The concept of an urban-rural divide is a key determinant for immunization success in Indonesia. Although the majority of the population lives in urban areas, 63% of all unvaccinated children live in rural areas, posing specific challenges [7]. In these sub-national variabilities, geographic and logistic challenges as well as local government priorities are critical factors. In the context of decentralization, district governments are responsible for service delivery, such as the operational costs of facilities, health worker incentives, cold chain, and other supporting activities. In many districts, potential lack of commitment, comprehensive planning, and budget execution capacity are strongly correlated with low contributions of local governments to support the immunization program\xe2\x80\x99s activities. In addition, the wealthy and the well-educated are more likely to complete their vaccinations, even in urban areas where everyone has a near equal chance of having or reinitiating contact with the immunization services. Immunization rates are higher in the wealthiest quintile, compared with the poorest quintile [6]. The COVID-19 pandemic aggravates the challenge to deal with those already existing problems.\r\nObviously, the COVID-19 pandemic is a disruptive event that causes severe social, economic, and political stress. We analyzed several scenarios for reductions in immunization coverage as compared to the situation before the pandemic. Specifically, we estimated the impact of the pandemic in reducing the basic childhood immunization coverage by immunization coverage reductions in each province by 5%, 10%, and 20% in respective scenarios. Since Java is the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic with approximately 82% of total confirmed cases and 70% of total deaths in Indonesia [8], we assumed the impact of the pandemic in reducing immunization coverage would be doubled in all provinces of Java. We estimated the basic childhood immunization coverage would be 53%, 50%, and 43% for the respective scenarios of immunization coverage reductions at 5%, 10%, and 20% (see Table 1). Reductions can be assumed to be related to school closures, whereas health-care centers may now present as an alternative option. Yet, vaccine hesitancy may present a next obstacle. \r\nTable 1.  The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on basic childhood immunization coverage.\r\nThe experience of the diphtheria outbreak in Indonesia in 2017 showed that low vaccination coverage was associated with the lack of access to immunization services, the lack of awareness about the benefits of vaccination, and vaccine hesitancy [9]. A recent study on parents\xe2\x80\x99 hesitancy toward vaccination in Aceh and West Sumatera, Indonesia highlighted that the majority of respondents would not want their children to get vaccinated [10]. Now on top of that, parents worry to go to health-care centers because of scare for COVID-19 infection. A study by Santoli et al. indicated a significant decrease on the coverage of non-influenza childhood vaccines in the USA because parents are concerned about taking their children to the general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic [11].\r\nTo maintain immunization rates in this pandemic situation with school closures, central and local governments are urged to establish mitigation programs to ascertain that immunization services will remain fully accessible through health-care centers. It is well known that decision-making processes regarding vaccination are complex and this process tends to be more complicated and multidimensional in a pandemic situation [9]. Therefore, well-designed campaigns should be applied to minimize perceived barriers and increase expectations regarding vaccine accessibility, efficacy, and pandemic interventions, such as practice good hygiene and physical distancing, at the same time. In the context of Indonesia, these campaigns should be integrated adequately within the most trusted sectors of society, i.e. religion and healthcare, with critical roles played by trusted individuals in the vaccination delivery programs and religious leaderships [9].\r\nThe pandemic is profoundly affecting the countries\xe2\x80\x99 economic growth, but the depth and duration of the shock are unusually uncertain. The World Bank estimated that the economy in Indonesia is projected to decline by 2.1\xe2\x80\x933.5% in 2020, coming from an increase of 5.0% in 2019 [12]. In addition, as a middle-income country, Indonesia is designated to explore internal co-financing of vaccines since financial assistances have been gradually phased out. With economic decline and the country\xe2\x80\x99s started transition to fully self-financing its immunization program in 2019, Indonesia needs to find extra sources of new resources to replace about 10\xe2\x80\x9315% externally financed share of the immunization program budget [7]. In addition, as a highly decentralized country, local governments frequently fail to properly execute their resource allocation of the entire health-care budget, whereas the central government has limited ability to influence how resources are allocated at the district level where delivery is done. This also further enhances noted high variability in outputs and outcomes in immunization persists. Such organization of financing sources for the immunization program may threaten its performance also due to the danger of resulting complexity in understanding roles and responsibilities between central and local governments.\r\nNext to maintaining immunization performance, the central government is now struggling to warrant the immunization budget as a result of the pandemic impact. It should be highlighted that the immunization budget in Indonesia is not determined by forecasting needs, but by the level of acceptance of the Ministry of National Development Planning to fit the needs of the healthcare system into the Ministry of Finance\xe2\x80\x99s assigned ceiling. Up to now, Indonesia has not yet applied significant efforts to create new potential revenue-generating strategies. An option of taxing on socially harmful goods, such as tobacco and alcohol, has not yet been considered by the government to finance the health-care programs, including immunization. As of yet, Indonesia has rather expressed strong interest in resource tracking and efficiency gains rather than a push for revenue generation. Again, this focus potentially endangers the financial sustainability of the immunization program in Indonesia. Both mitigating the pandemic and maintaining the coverage and success of the immunization program should reflect integrated efforts to control infection spread and reduce the illness attack rate. To be financed over the medium and long term in an uncertain economy, this integrated effort should be considered as an investment in Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s future rather than a cost burden. A realistic approach to expand fiscal space is needed through efficiency gains both in other public sectors and the health-care sector itself, inclusive immunization, and through new innovative interventions and investments for generating revenues.\r\nTable 1.
