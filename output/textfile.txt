The World Health Organization (WHO) declared novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 which engulfed the world like wild fire in less than 2 months. It has played havoc with the lives of people restricting their movement, confining them to their homes for months, devastating the economy, and causing psychological issues in some of them. In the unprecedented threat of the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on communities and nations across the globe, religious leaders and faith-based organizations may play a crucial role in saving lives and mitigating the spread of the disease. Religious leaders and faith-based organizations are primary source of support, comfort, guidance, direct health care and social service, for the communities they serve and people who have staunch belief in them. Most of the religious-minded people visit their places of worship frequently and often join the congregations on special occasions, making them vulnerable to any infectious disease prevailing at that time. Ensuring awareness and dispelling pseudoscientific practices is a necessity for such communities in India to contain and control the coronavirus infection, as it presents unique threat owing to the geographical vastness and the complexity of its cultural and religious diversity, beliefs, and practices coexisting with poor social indicators in this country. A study was conducted to understand the role of religious practices in the spread and mitigation of COVID-19.\r\nPublication Date:26 October 2020 (online)\r\n\xc2\xa9 2020.

To test the proposed model, data were collected from 300 Chinese firms which have adopted cloud computing. To analyze the data, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used. An importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) was also conducted to identify the critical factors that exhibit high importance but low performance.\r\nThe results of the study revealed that end-user satisfaction, information quality, system quality, managerial information technology (IT) capability and technical IT capability significantly affect cloud computing success. Additionally, cloud computing success has a strong and positive impact on firm performance. IPMA further confirms that managers need to concentrate more on system quality, information quality, user satisfaction and technical IT capability.\r\nThis paper is one of the few attempts to integrate several theoretical frameworks (i.e. IT capabilities and resource-based view, expectation-confirmation theory, and information system success theory) to develop a comprehensive model for understanding the key determinants of cloud computing success and its impact on firm performance. This study makes a useful contribution to the conventional information systems (IS) literature and IT management practice.\r\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71810107003].\r\n\r\nKhayer, A., Bao, Y. and Nguyen, B.

However, in order to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19, a potentially deadly disease, it is imperative that community-dwelling older adults physically distance themselves from supportive family, friends, and even traditional faith-based activities. In this report, we explore the ways in which spirituality was used to manage stressors during this pandemic. This is a qualitative descriptive study with content analysis of data from the narratives from 18 African American breast cancer survivors. Participants were interviewed via phone and video conferencing platform and asked to respond to questions of strategies used to manage stressors encountered during this COVID-19 pandemic. Spirituality enabled African American breast cancer survivors to better manage their psychological distress through (1) increased engagement in religious activities; (2) reliance on God for protection when fearful, feeling isolated, and in need of assistance to pay household bills; (3) finding joy and courage from listening to gospel music and reading scripture; and (4) finding meaning through spirituality. These findings suggest that in spite of physical distancing requirements that impose limited access to faith-based institutions during this COVID-19 pandemic, spirituality continues to be a supportive resource to manage emotional stressors.\r\nAmong women diagnosed with breast cancer, racial disparities persist and are especially evident among African American women [1]. African American women diagnosed with breast cancer continue to have the highest mortality rates as well as the second highest incidence rates [1]. In fact, the cancer death rate for non-Hispanic African American women is 41% higher than non-Hispanic white women. Although the mortality rates for breast cancer have been declining, a racial disparity persists for African American women [1]. Financial difficulties, lack of provider sensitivity, and an absence of family support are among those major patient concerns that contribute to this racial disparity in breast cancer. African American women with breast cancer are now faced with being in the category of individuals at a higher risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 [2, 3]. In comparison to other racial/ethnic groups, African Americans are nearly four times as likely to die from COVID-19 [2]. In addition, comorbidities such as heart disease, asthma, obesity, and diabetes are prevalent among African American breast cancer patients so that if COVID-19 is contracted, the outcome is likely to result in death [4, 5].\r\nAfrican American women generally rely on their spirituality to cope with psychosocial issues encountered during cancer survivorship [6, 7]. However in order to mitigate the risk of contracting this potentially deadly disease, it is imperative that community-dwelling older adults physically distance themselves from family, friends, and even traditional faith-based activities [8]. For many African Americans, access to social support and religious services at faith-based institutions is a challenge; therefore, this population is likely to experience higher levels of social isolation, loneliness, and psychological distress [9,10,11,12]. This pandemic in particular is associated with higher levels of hopelessness, loneliness, and depression that is highest among women, individuals with the lowest household incomes, individuals with existing chronic conditions, [13] and older women who live alone [14]. Loneliness in particular is likely to result in higher levels of psychological distress [15,16,17] which is especially evident in research among older African American adults where loneliness was associated with high levels of perceived stress and poor mental health [12].\r\nAfrican Americans have a long cultural history of using their spirituality for purposes of keeping the memories of ancestors alive and for the intergenerational transmission of important survival strategies [18,19,20]. Older African Americans in particular were more likely to transmit stories of \xe2\x80\x9cmaking it through\xe2\x80\x9d times of oppression and serious illness that incorporate their strong religious culture [18,19,20]. Historically, the use of religious songs and Bible verses as expressions of spirituality were memorized and transmitted orally as a strategy that has given African Americans meaning to their human existence [21]. Biblical text and lyrics of religious songs, for example, were used frequently among African slaves to provide insight into their belief systems as well as their connectedness to God and to other individuals who were suffering and powerless [18,19,20]. Moreover, among African Americans, Biblical text was a source for stories that allowed transcendence from a current situation of suffering to some other place or time. A reliance on spirituality further helped African Americans to view the relief of pain and sorrow of other faithful servants as evidence of God\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect, strengthen, and heal [18, 22].\r\nIn this report, we draw from the narratives of older African American breast cancer survivors for an exploration of the ways in which spirituality is used to cope during this COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from these interviews will permit a glimpse into the use of spirituality to cope, whether participants have adapted this strategy to be relevant during this time, and benefits of this coping strategy during this pandemic.\r\nIn this report, we used a qualitative descriptive design including purposive sampling, open-ended semi-structured interviews, qualitative content analysis, and quantitative descriptive analysis. Approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Emory University.\r\nThe interviews included in this report are from 18 African American women and breast cancer survivors residing in the Southeastern United States, African American ethnicity by self-report, at least 18 years old but less than 89 years, and survivors of cancer. Participants for these interviews were generally recruited through an African American breast cancer support group with whom the fourth author of this report is founding member.\r\nThe first author conducted semi-structured interviews lasting 15\xe2\x80\x9345 min. Participants were interviewed via phone and video conferencing platform and asked to respond to questions of strategies used to manage stressors encountered during this COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were given a $30 gift card for each interview. All interviews were conducted in April and May of 2020.\r\nAll interviews were conducted with only interviewee and first author present. Participants were encouraged to freely express issues and experiences related to spirituality. Interviews were audiotaped and later transcribed verbatim with a research assistant reviewing each transcript for accuracy. Member checking was conducted with members of the target population and clergy during the process of data collection and drafting of this report to validate the interpretation of findings, generation of themes, and accuracy of conclusions.\r\nIn order to content analyze the data, a table was initially constructed to organize each participant\xe2\x80\x99s responses by category of text related to spirituality as expressed among these participants\xe2\x80\x99 narrative responses. These spiritually grounded responses included religious practices associated with faith-based institutions as well as meanings derived from beliefs associated with these practices.\r\nThe interviews included in this report are from 18 older African American cancer survivors residing in the Southeastern United States (see Table 1). The participants were on average 58 years old with stage 0\xe2\x80\x932 breast cancer (88.9%); married (38.9%); college educated (44.4%); employed full time (55.6%); and resided in rural areas (67%).\r\nIn the paragraphs to follow, we describe with participant quotes, the perspectives of the ways in which spirituality is used to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic among African American women breast cancer survivors. Specifically, the ways in which spirituality enables African American breast cancer survivors to better manage their psychological distress were through (1) increased engagement in religious activities; (2) reliance on God for protection when fearful, feeling isolated, and in need of assistance to pay household bills; (3) finding joy and courage from listening to gospel music and reading scripture; and (4) finding meaning through spirituality. To date only a few scholars have examined the ways in which spirituality is a coping resource among African American breast cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants have been provided fictitious names to protect their identity.\r\nIn this category, participants described ways in which they increased participation in religious activities to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Ms. Morrison is a 61-year-old, stage 2, four-year survivor of breast cancer. She described the changes made in her attendance at worship services during the COVID-19 pandemic:\r\nBut we actually do a lot over the phone. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching other - I\xe2\x80\x99m on Facebook so I have friends that are ministers so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching their Facebook live. So like I told my friend yesterday I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in church all day because everybody came on at different times. And even if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t come on at different times they\xe2\x80\x99re still on there so you can be able to go back and listen to them.\r\nShe also described the increased religious service participation she has observed in others:\r\nBut I think you know, more people are going, you know, to Christ now because everything is unpredictable or they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s really going on so they have to go to God to understand.\r\nAnother participant, Mrs. Sherill, a 59-year-old, stage 0 (DCIS), seven-year survivor of breast cancer had this to say about the change in the religious practice of prayer to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic:\r\nPrayer is more prevalent in my life now because of COVID than it had been before. I think I just find myself just thanking the Lord throughout the day just for being able to have a job.\r\nEven though I\xe2\x80\x99m working remotely, downstairs I have, posted on my desk, I have a scripture here; I have a scripture\xe2\x80\xa6 you know, I have all around me. I listen to gospel music most of the time during the day. I have my devotion every morning.\r\nIn this category, participants described a reliance on God to cope with fear, social isolation, and to provide for food and shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 72-year-old, stage 3, 19-year survivor of breast cancer described her religious belief in God\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect:\r\nHe is going to protect us through this. And not only that, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, it could be His doing that\xe2\x80\x99s not to harm us, but we have gotten so, busy, busy, busy in this life, in this world,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, rest for a minute; just take a breath; just rest; rest in my Word; rest in me. I just had a moment to where it\xe2\x80\x99s almost like fear tried to grip my heart. But I had to go inside and rely on what I knew to be true concerning the word of God. And for a moment there you know that\xe2\x80\x99s what I had to do. Well when you are a believer you\xe2\x80\x99re just that. You come to believe that even though you are here in this world you believe that God is greater than what you see around you. He\xe2\x80\x99s able to comfort you. He can protect you because his word says it and you become a believer in him. You become a believer in what he said. And that\xe2\x80\x99s my protection right there. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole of who I am as a child of God with my faith. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole of who I am. My faith is in God. Because if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I probably could only imagine what some people are actually experiencing today with everything that is going on. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fear. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of anxiety. There is a lot of stress. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of hopelessness all around me. But I have learned enough.\r\nMrs. Dillingham is a 62-year-old, stage 2, two-year survivor of breast cancer. In her narrative, she describes feeling down as a result of not being able to socialize and embrace family and friends. However, talking to God and family by phone and social media has helped to alleviate those depressed moods:\r\nMy communication is not as prevalent as it was and that kind of gets me down sometimes because of this. Not able to go out and socialize. They do call and check on me and see how I\xe2\x80\x99m doing. But I\xe2\x80\x99m a hugger. I like to hug and I like to socialize. That has been taken. It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go out because it\xe2\x80\x99s your choice. It\xe2\x80\x99s another thing when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a choice or say in the matter. It kind of gets me down sometimes. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve had some little emotional bouts in my home being by myself. I talk to God a lot. I have to, you know? That keeps me going. I talk to my family every day. We\xe2\x80\x99re on the phone every day. We can even do video chats and it\xe2\x80\x99s so nice. On Saturday Sisters Network got together and we did a Zoom.\r\nA reliance on God for money to pay household bills was a coping strategy for Mrs. Smith, a 48-year-old, stage 2, eight-year survivor of breast cancer. Her experience, like many other African Americans, included the loss of income and ability to buy food and pay household bills including those for utilities and car note. Mrs. Smith recalled her experience and a reliance on her faith in God:\r\nMy faith is keeping me grounded. Because I know all of us that believe in the power of God we\xe2\x80\x99re grounded so my faith has kept me grounded and kept me sane while going through this. I\xe2\x80\x99m actually one whose job had to shut down due to the virus and I am not receiving unemployment. I had actually put in my unemployment back in February before everything started shutting down and my stuff is still pending. So through the grace of God my mortgage is current. My car note is not due until May. They went ahead and set up a few of my payments at the end of the loan. And I thank God that the utility company, you know, putting a freeze on the disconnections. But I know as time goes on, you know, the bills are going to add up. And I\xe2\x80\x99m just thankful that I have people that are in my corner that I can go to anytime that I\xe2\x80\x99m in need. So there\xe2\x80\x99s food and everything - I\xe2\x80\x99m good. My faith is carrying me through.\r\nIn response to the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, participants were able to find joy and peace in a favorite religious song or Biblical text. Mrs. Smith referred to Isaiah 4:10 as the scripture that gets her through stressful times:\r\nBut I know that what I relied on as far as faith and prayer but I relied on Isaiah 4 verse 10 which was the one that got me through. And I was listening to this song that my sister sings. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Faith Is. Because the song says faith is my hope in you. Faith is my trust in you and it also says I\xe2\x80\x99m an overcomer. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how I see myself. I\xe2\x80\x99m more than a conqueror and I\xe2\x80\x99m an overcomer. And so whenever I feel a little down I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to that song and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to that scripture.\r\nMs. West is a 59-year-old, stage 2, two-year survivor of breast cancer who finds joy in singing to relieve stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. She especially finds joy in singing songs that are reassuring and positive. Ms. West describes the joy from hearing religious songs from an Easter Service:\r\nLike you said singing is a joy for me because I sing on the choir. Singing is a joy for me. That makes me feel good. When I sing positive songs and reassuring songs, that\xe2\x80\x99s a joy for me. Listening to gospel music. Like somebody sent a tape through an Email and they said we\xe2\x80\x99ve been apart and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had... because of this situation but they wanted to send a reminder of songs we sang last year. They sent a recording of the songs we sang last Easter and it was so uplifting just to hear it. You know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying? So things like that you know I have to focus on that.\r\nMs. Russell is a 50-year-old, stage 1, eight-year survivor of breast cancer who described a specific Biblical text used to overcome her fears of being in the COVID-19 pandemic. This breast cancer survivor recalled previous environmental threats such as the Spanish Flu and Smallpox and other plagues referenced in the Holy Bible. According to Ms. Russell:\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s happened many years whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Spanish flu, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s smallpox. There\xe2\x80\x99s different things that come throughout the world that happens and it\xe2\x80\x99s just our time to go through it. My main and probably only Bible verse that I read constantly and still to this day is 2Timothy 1:7. That God hasn\xe2\x80\x99t given you the spirit of fear that\xe2\x80\x99s how I got through those fearful, fearful, times where I just knew over and over again that, you know. . . .For God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind. That was and still is my go-to verse. Of course I read other verses too but that\xe2\x80\x99s the main one I hold close to my heart. When I\xe2\x80\x99m fearful. When I\xe2\x80\x99m scared. When I\xe2\x80\x99m worried. When I\xe2\x80\x99m a little anxious about anything. When I\xe2\x80\x99m doubting something.\r\nThe ability to find purpose and meaning through one\xe2\x80\x99s spirituality was expressed among these African American breast cancer survivors. Mrs. Dillingham, a 62-year-old, stage 2, two-year survivor of breast cancer, shared her perceptions of finding purpose and meaning via her spirituality. For Mrs. Dillingham, the COVID-19 pandemic was a time to refocus:\r\nGod gave us this time off to do self-reflection. Look inside ourselves and see if we know where we\xe2\x80\x99re at, you know? And coming out of this how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be better. What are you going to do differently?\r\nFor other survivors, comfort was found in Biblical text with references to God\xe2\x80\x99s ability to bring His children through pandemics. Mrs. Winston, a 49-year-old, stage 2 two-year survivor of breast cancer described the Biblical story of Noah and the Ark. Adhering to the mandates for sheltering in place was similar to the Biblical story Noah staying in the Ark until it was safe to come out after the flood:\r\nI think biblical you know you\xe2\x80\x99re bringing up the plagues. Thinking back in that time, thinking about Noah and the ark. How when the flood came he and his family they had to go in and stay until it was time to come out so relating it to that.\r\nThe goal of this report was to explore the ways in which African American cancer survivors use their spirituality to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic. We purposively used the narratives of African American women who are breast cancer survivors for this exploration as they are a high-risk group for poor outcomes should they contract this potentially deadly virus.\r\nThe analysis of the narratives of these African American survivors of breast cancer illustrates that there are at least four responses to the stress encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, one response was through an increased engagement in religious activities. Although these women were restricted from attending church activities in person, they found on-line services that permitted them to actually engage in more worship services than previously when there were no COVID-19 restrictions. This finding is consistent with other reports of African Americans adapting to their needs for spiritual support via churches through on-line and social media formats during this pandemic [23]. However, since not all churches have resources for an on-line format, benefits such as fellowship with congregants and support and encouragement from this interaction are missing [24]. Although the response of increased religious activities during stressful life events is not novel, the benefit from the availability of worship services from local churches through social media during extended periods isolation even after the pandemic ends should be further explored.\r\nA second type of increased engagement in religious activities included prayer. A realization among these participants was that the threat and potential harm from this pandemic was larger and more powerful than any other and one only God could alleviate [25]. This response of relying on God to cope with fear, social isolation, and to provide for food and shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic brings to our attention to a function of spirituality not emphasized in literature during this pandemic. The closure of churches and requirements for physical distancing has led to feelings of social isolation and loneliness that has been stressful for many African Americans [23]. An increasing reliance on connectedness through phone and social media fills the void for social interactions for some but not all. The findings from previous research suggest that a lack of meaningful social interactions adversely affects one\xe2\x80\x99s mental and physical health; however, the short- and long-term effects from physical distancing imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic are unclear. Additionally, African Americans have been especially impacted by financial hardships such as the loss of income. This financial hardship is apparent in the long lines of cars showing up at food banks, the individuals in jeopardy of being evicted from their homes, and the increased loss of health insurance that accompanies unemployment.\r\nA third response was related to listening to gospel music and reading Biblical text during stressful life events. These religious practices are consistent with and further extend what is known about the functioning of these practices to calm, strengthen, and encourage [26, 27]. Not surprisingly, these breast cancer survivors also relied on a religious song or Biblical text previously used\xc2\xa0to cope during their diagnosis and treatment for cancer. Although religious songs have previously been referred to as sources of comfort and strength [27], these breast cancer survivors also referred to religious songs as a source of joy and reminder that they were conquerors and overcomers. Reading Biblical text provided an additional resource for the relief of fears and anxieties through the belief that an all-powerful Deity is an important source of protection [26].\r\nThe fourth and final category was the use of spirituality to find meaning and purpose during the COVID-19 pandemic. For these breast cancer survivors, the mandate for physical distancing has resulted in time alone to reflect and think. This time of reflection resulted in a refocus on individual life goals, reconnection with old friends by phone or social media, or even engagement in life-long learning opportunities through attendance in available online courses. These participants recalled previous plagues from the Bible, God\xe2\x80\x99s purpose for calamities, ways in which individuals survived those times through being obedient. Similarly, survivorship of the COVID-19 pandemic is possible through adhering to the mandates for physical distancing.\r\nAfrican American breast cancer survivors are a high-risk population during the COVID-19 pandemic and spirituality is an important coping mechanism for this population. Important questions for future inquiry would be whether the use of spiritualty as described in this report is sufficient to buffer the short- and long-term effects of social isolation, loneliness, and stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nThe strengths of this study lie in the ability to capture the spiritually influenced strategies used to manage encounters with stressors among an at-risk population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The interviews were conducted fairly early in the pandemic and therefore capture early adaptations to disruptions in traditional spiritually influenced strategies during this pandemic amidst\xc2\xa0mandates for physical distancing and closures of faith-based institutions.\r\nThere are a few limitations. Due to physical distancing mandates, participants were interviewed via telephone or video conferencing and it is unclear whether this mode of collecting data provided the same level of ease as a person-to-person format. Secondly, the small sample size and qualitative methodology format limits our ability to generalize to a larger population. However, the purpose is not to generalize to a larger population of breast cancer survivors but rather to generate knowledge that expands the current evidence related to the use of spirituality during this pandemic.\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly threatening among African American populations. African American women who are survivors of breast cancer are especially at high risk for not only contracting but also dying from this virus. African American women generally rely on their spirituality to cope with psychosocial issues encountered during cancer survivorship; however, the findings from this study suggest that spirituality continues to be an important strategy in spite of physical distancing and church closures. These breast cancer survivors were more engaged in religious practices, relying on God for protection, finding joy and courage through religious songs and reading Biblical text, and finding purpose in their lives during this pandemic. Educational efforts should target health care providers to assist their cancer patients to think of alternative ways to meet their needs for spiritual support during this pandemic. For example, cancer patients might be encouraged to locate on-line worship services or to reflect on other historical and Biblical plagues that required physical distancing. Secondly, health care practitioners might encourage cancer patients to sing, hum, or recite the lyrics of a favorite song or Biblical text when anxious or worried. Finally, cancer survivors find meaning and purpose in \xe2\x80\x9cgiving back\xe2\x80\x9d through supporting other cancer patients. Health care practitioners might encourage the cancer survivor to redirect goals to those that can be accomplished during this time of physical distancing and limited access to traditional faith-based activities. These efforts are likely to enable the cancer survivor to overcome social isolation and loneliness that frequently leads to high levels of stress and poor mental health outcomes.\r\nNot applicable.\r\nNot applicable.\r\nAmerican Cancer Society.

In this context, many people found themselves in great difficulty, not only because of the fear of contagion or the economic problems deriving from the closure of production activities but also because the virus profoundly changed the way of life in society. The \xe2\x80\x9cSocial distancing\xe2\x80\x9d concept became central in all personal relationships, including close family relationships. In this situation, our paper seeks to understand the role of spirituality and religiosity in reacting to this difficult situation and in particular on the physical and psychological health of the people involved. The data we present here are part of a multidisciplinary research with a quantitative theoretical framework. As the data was collected during the first Italian lockdown, a total of 1,250 adults from all over Italy participated in the on-line questionnaire. Among the main results it emerged that the participants perceived lower levels of spiritual well-being and mental health than the pre-pandemic situation with a significant gender difference; in fact, women perceived lower mental health than men. At the same time, it is evident that spirituality and religious practices are a protective factor connected not only with psychological and mental but also physical health. Finally, it appears evident that the family is a protective factor with respect to mental health, even in a period so full of stress factors, those who did not live alone and especially those who had to take care of small children reported higher perceived mental health and a greater ability to activate coping resources.\r\nThe catastrophic and unstoppable nature of COVID-19 has produced a series of devastating effects from an economic, social and psychological point of view at a global level. At different times and with different strategies, the whole world is tackling the challenges dictated by the pandemic, implementing physical distancing and the partial or general closure of shops, sports centers, schools, community centers and religious institutions, also encouraging, where possible, smart-working (1). In this way, points of reference and crucial meeting places for socialization and also for the performance of religious functions, which are such necessary pillars for mutual support in general, and even more fundamental in this complex period, have been lacking. Despite this, the population, demonstrating resilience and marked adaptation skills, immediately implemented compensatory strategies to cope with the social isolation into which they were forced: in fact, innumerable initiatives were created online to offer solidarity physical, psychological and spiritual well-being. Online communities came together to practice recreational, sports and spiritual-religious activities \xe2\x80\x9ctogether.\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, Yang et al., for example, argue how the use of 360\xc2\xb0 virtual tour offer a tourist experience in a moment in which the directives are to stay at home; this type of activity can, therefore, help reduce the stress caused by the pandemic (2).\r\nThese activities, particularly of a religious nature, made it possible to reduce the physical distances imposed by forced isolation without putting people's health at risk (3, 4), helping to reduce the negative effects of isolation, particularly in older people (5, 6). For many people, spiritual and religious practices give meaning, purpose and constitute a supportive community (7, 8). While, on the one hand the online initiatives managed to mitigate the negative effects of this situation, on the other, the restrictions adopted, while managing to slow down the infection, did not lead to the reduction of deaths, at least in some areas of the world where they continue to be high: today there are 1.18 million victims worldwide, of which 277.135 in Europe alone and unfortunately the statistics vary considerably day after day (9).\r\nAlthough death is the natural conclusion of the life cycle, the suddenness of this event, its mass diffusion and the consequent interruption of socially shared funeral rituals and practices, on the other hand, have certainly limited the functional capacity of the victims' relatives to process death (10, 11); this has contributed to prolonged pain, thus increasing the risk of complicated bereavement (10) which can result in prolonged bereavement disorder (12). This situation has undoubtedly contributed to compromising essential areas of mental and physical functioning (13).\r\nAs Thun\xc3\xa8-Boyle et al. (14) underline, religion and spirituality appear as parts of the same chromatic scale. Although religion and spirituality represent, in fact, two different constructs, they are nevertheless strictly interconnected and difficult to separate (15). Furthermore, the literature highlights how they are the reference point for the life of many people, especially in times of difficulty (16\xe2\x80\x9320). Religiosity has been defined as a multidimensional construct, oriented toward institutions and traditions (21), considered as a system of beliefs and practices (22) and defined by norms, rules, dogmas and rituals, uniting people who share the same creed (18).\r\nMany authors have highlighted how those who are faced with adverse personal life situations such as a disease like cancer (23, 24) or the death of a loved one (25\xe2\x80\x9327), particularly troubled migration paths (28, 29) or events involving the wider community such as earthquakes, tsunamis (30) tend to be more religious. As reported by Galen (31), the effects of religiosity on well-being seem to be related more to social support, a healthy lifestyle and the idea of existential certainty, than to the religious content of the beliefs in themselves; it would seem, in fact, that a large part of the advantage of religious individuals derives from being members of social groups. Spirituality, on the other hand, is seen as a more intimate dimension (18), a larger construct, an individual effort to discover the sacred or meaning of life (22) without confessional constraints (21, 32). Furthermore, it is defined by Puchalski et al. (33) as essential for humanity, a dimension, therefore, which contains within it philosophical, cultural and religious beliefs and practices.\r\nSpirituality, a source of comfort, support and meaning (7), instills the idea of a sense of belonging and existential interconnectedness, promoting mental health (34). In the literature, in fact, the accent has been placed on the association that exists between having spirituality and having a greater perception of well-being, physical and mental health (7, 19, 34, 34\xe2\x80\x9337). A particularly important aspect is related to coping, or the function performed by spiritual well-being in the management of stressful events. Spiritual coping can be understood as cognitive and behavioral efforts to find or maintain meaning, purpose and connection in the face of difficult situations (38).\r\nFurthermore, some authors over the years have argued that faith and spirituality can also be perceived as a source of resilience both from a physical, psychological and mental point of view (7, 39).\r\nEspecially in stressful situations, faith and spirituality seem to also act positively (3, 40, 41) on the immune system, particularly for older people (3, 40) who are also those most involved in religious and/or spiritual activities (15). Furthermore, spiritual well-being is defined as a state that connects the mind and body of the individual, society, intelligence and health, supporting the individual in his/her attitudes and life goals (42). According to Ellison (43), moreover, spiritual well-being includes both a psycho-social dimension and a more religious dimension, a unifying force that aims to integrate the physical, emotional and social dimensions of health. A study by Saiz et al. (44) demonstrated that spirituality in people with heart failure has broader associations with measures of psychosocial and physical symptoms than belonging to a religious organization and that religious affiliation alone did not emerge as a reliable predictor for health benefits. Indeed, it was even counterproductive: in fact they found that those who belonged to a religious organization, but with a low level of spirituality, perceived a state of anxiety and greater emotional fatigue. The literature also highlights how spiritual well-being is significantly higher in women than in men (34, 45).\r\nClosely connected to spiritual well-being, there are spiritual needs, which include everything that refers to the need to find meaning, value in one's life, peace and a sense of connection. These needs are not necessarily exclusively religious; in fact, even those who do not have a religious faith still refer to systems of beliefs that provide feelings of meaning and purpose (46). In this period of the COVID-19 pandemic they seem to assume a role and an even deeper meaning in relation to the bewilderment that people are confronted with when faced with such a pervasive, disruptive event, creating daily fragility, fear and uncertainty. In particular, the spiritual distress in those people going through adverse situations, such as that caused by COVID-19, should not be underestimated. By spiritual distress we mean suffering connected to the impossibility of feeling meaning in life, a state of anguish that occurs when an individual experience suffering that in some way undermines their personal identity, for example by raising existential questions about the reason for that particular suffering (47, 48).\r\nReligion and spirituality, therefore, are particularly fundamental and worthy of study in this highly complex period: COVID-19 and its physical, social and psychological consequences represent a challenge for the mental well-being of the entire world population (37, 49).\r\nIn contemporary society characterized by a process of individualization of subjects who experience a social condition of extreme loneliness, as well as isolation, the experience of death is also progressively isolated (50) when not, tragically, removed (51, 52). There are many strategies for concealing death, some are its spectacularization and mediatic overexposure (51), others offer the solution of a \xe2\x80\x9ccosmic\xe2\x80\x9d death (52). In the latter case, the anguish of death is resolved by removing it from the individual experience. Elias (50) underlines how the loneliness of the dying person begins with their progressive isolation and has, among its consequences, the loss of the ability to empathize both with the suffering and the mourning event. In a certain sense, death is no longer part of contemporary society, which prefers to represent itself in the power of youth frozen in suspended time.\r\nEach society has tried and tries to make sense of the human story starting from the most tragic experience of the end, which interrupts the flow of earthly life, as we know it. For many scholars, the experience of death is the central cultural theme of various societies, from ancient (53) to contemporary (54) to peasant societies in southern Italy (51). Specifically, the rituals of death give meaning to the cultural representations of the living-dead relationship (51), which are expressed through rituals organized in different practices, temporalities and aesthetics (55, 56) but all marked by the centrality of the body of the deceased and of the community committed to overcoming the mourning event.\r\nThe cultural shaping of this event, through the ritual that accompanies mourning, serves to allow the passage of the dead from the world of the living to the afterlife and, at the same time, guarantees the recovery of the community of the living (51, 57). In this perspective, the importance of the celebration of rites and of the community dimension of this celebration is clear, with a progression from the family community of loved ones (51, 55, 57) up to including the collectivity of acquaintances or an entire community. Ultimately, the death rituals that accompany mourning allow us to transcend the risk of a second and more tragic death, namely the risk for survivors of getting entangled in the mournful tragedy of the loss of a loved one and forever losing their ability to \xe2\x80\x9cBe stronger in the world\xe2\x80\x9d the closer they were to the missing person (57).\r\nLoewenthal and Dein (58) emphasize how religious rituals offer a range of positive mental health benefits, from reduced anxiety to meaning in life and a sense of community. Moreover, as reported by Willard et al. (59), institutional religious practices sometimes affect subjective well-being even more than personal belief or individual spirituality. Finally, the lack of rituals can compromise the ability to connect with the deceased (10), strongly affecting the restoration of well-being in those who remain and who must face mourning their loss without moments of sharing with a wider relational network. which can offer support. \xe2\x80\x9cThe absence of ritual, such as a funeral, often results in disenfranchised grief, and lacking social or cultural recognition impairs support resources that assist the grieving process\xe2\x80\x9d [(13). p. 80]. The process of mourning requires a complex convergence of affective responses, cognitive, behavioral, physical and spiritual adaptations that take shape through rituals and flow into an individualized equilibrium that is a source of well-being.\r\nThe pandemic has produced a shock of reality, progressively exposing us to the awareness of an extreme risk, that of death, as a collective community experience, typical of situations of war and natural catastrophes, as opposed to an individual one, in which the experience of passing away acquired the tragedy of an individual and family history.\r\nThe death curve in the representation of the disease by experts has become the daily account of the pandemic. In just 1 day, on March 28, 2020, in Lombardy alone, the most affected region of northern Italy, there were 542 deaths from COVID-19. The idea of the end took possession of us with an unprecedented emotional impact through the images from the city of Bergamo, the epicenter of one of the worst affected areas of Italy, of the dead closed in anonymous coffins, without names, without flowers, lined up in church on their last journey in solitude to the afterlife. Coffins, also in Bergamo, transported on military trucks in convoy through the streets of the deserted city, where the living were forced to stay at home, experiencing physical and spiritual distancing from loved ones who were denied the last farewell, so as to safeguard public health, eliminating the rite of the public and collective funeral that restores humanity to such a painful moment for families.\r\nAbove all, the silence and emptiness in which this convoy took place was striking. The sense of suspension of time, of loneliness, of lack of reality burst into our lives through the images that came to us from TV and social media and embody that fear, which progressively, starting from the onset of the pandemic, has turned into terror and bewilderment. The pandemic, from being a word of difficult scientific meanings, now acquires a precise, full and absolute meaning: Death.\r\nThe people who die, as well as the people who remain, relatives, family members, friends and the many spectators who feel part of an \xe2\x80\x9cexistential community of destiny\xe2\x80\x9d (60), are all condemned to isolation, besides loneliness, faced with the triumph of the deadly virus. According to Migliorati (61), death in the first period of the pandemic broke out as \xe2\x80\x9caseptic death,\xe2\x80\x9d separated from the individual experience and projected into an anonymous dimension of collective death. In the first period of lockdown, in fact, the dead and their relatives were out of the narrative. In this way, the narrative of death reduced the mournful event, albeit in its tragic nature, to a \xe2\x80\x9cside effect\xe2\x80\x9d of the pandemic, one of the many dimensions, perhaps even negligible. After all, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are all elderly, the average age is 81 years old, they all had previous pathologies\xe2\x80\x9d [(61). p 40]. The most effective symbolic image of this narrative was the juxtaposition between COVID-19 and war. The pandemic was recounted as a war with its victims (especially the elderly), its heroes (especially the health personnel), its generals, ready to save us with their field strategies (the government, virologists, experts). In short, in the pandemic, death essentially broke into an interpretative scheme that saw a shift of death along the nature-culture continuum toward nature in the sign of the removal of the corpse, away from culture, capable of transcending death through ritual (57).\r\nWhat happens when funerals are suspended? When the dead and their relatives go through the tragic passing alone? Because this is what happened during the lockdown in Italy: the dead were taken away alone, without a worthy accompaniment, and the living locked in their homes could not meet for worthy rituals that could ease that sudden and devastating pain and share it with people who cared. Thus, it follows that pain has no right of expression through those socially and culturally shared rituals (13); and it is precisely the absence of rituals that contributes to aggravating both the experience of mourning (13, 62) and the feelings of guilt and responsibility dictated by the conflict between what the victim's wishes were and what the state allowed (63).\r\nThe experience of death during COVID-19 goes far beyond situations of death by natural catastrophe in which the bodies are missing. In our case the relatives, reduced to members of the larger community that mourned their dead, witness the death of loved ones shut away in their homes. The tragedy of the suspension of rituals in the period of COVID-19 crossed with the tragedy of having to overcome the event alone, at home.\r\nThe pandemic has pushed the condition of loneliness, not only of the dying but also of the relatives, toward the most tragic of its epilogs. Experiments were attempted to alleviate the sense of loneliness and isolation in the face of death. For example, the creativity of a hospital chaplain in one of the most affected cities in northern Italy (Bergamo) allowed many relatives to participate remotely in the funeral ceremony via mobile phones. A coffin, a parish priest, a cell phone. All that remains of funeral participation in a period of forced isolation and media coverage of reality. As Dei (64) states \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the most inhuman aspect of this experiment of suspended sociality to which we are forced, even more cruel than the dystopian imaginary fanned by those philosophers who fear our reduction to bare life, is the denial of the rituals appointed to accompany the condolences\xe2\x80\x9d [(64). p 2].\r\nA cruelty that became more and more specific in the tragedy of a mourning event suspended, not overcome, entangled in the event of death, when with the passing of the weeks, toward the end of the lockdown period, from the indistinct magma of a collective death the personal stories, the family tragedies, the many faces of the dead and the remaining relatives emerged. At this point it was clear that the patriotic community which mourns its dead is unable to give meaning to the pain of the proximate community of family members, friends for the loss of a loved one.\r\nGiven the large number of people infected and of deaths in Italy caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this research focuses on the spiritual well-being and psychological impact of the general population during the lockdown. We believe that is important to deepen our knowledge of the perception of spiritual well-being and mental health so as to develop interventions and support people, to be ready for similar future events in order to reduce the negative consequences of a possible second wave of the virus.\r\nWe wish to pursue two main objectives. The first is to further investigate how spiritual well-being dimension was faced by Italian adults during the first weeks of lockdown subsequent to the COVID-19 outbreak. The second is to explore psychological mental health in terms of the psychological impact of the pandemic. We also set out to analyze if there were differences in the perception of spiritual well-being and mental health compared to the pre-pandemic data in the general population. The relationships between spiritual and psychological aspects were also investigated and how these two dimensions are associated with demographic variables (such as age, gender, level of education, marital status), socio-relational variables (such as people lived with, work situation, presence of children, religious beliefs) and the nearness with the COVID-19 disease, for example knowing someone who was infected or who died of coronavirus. We also assume that as spiritual well-being increases the perception of positive mental health increases and that socio-demographic variables, such as gender and age affect spiritual well-being and mental health.\r\nThe protocol included some questions created ad hoc by the research team following several focus groups, which made it possible to identify the areas to be investigated, listed below:\r\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Spiritual well-being: Jarel Spiritual Well-Being Scale (JSWB) (65, 66). Italian version validated by Magnano et al. (45) composed of 21 items with a five-point Likert scale from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree. The scale is composed of three factors: Faith and belief (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cPrayer is an important part of my life\xe2\x80\x9d), Meaning of life (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cI find meaning and purpose in my life\xe2\x80\x9d), and Quality of relationships (I am able to appreciate differences in others). The scale showed a good internal consistency (\xce\xb1 = 0.82). The higher the scores, the greater the spiritual well-being.\r\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mental health: General Health Questionnaire-12 items (GHQ-12): this scale measures the state of mental health over the past few weeks and was developed by Goldberg in the 70s and validated in Italy by Piccinelli et al. (67). The 12-item version, GHQ-12, was the most widely used (68). Participants had to report whether they experienced a particular symptom of mental distress according to a four-point Likert-type scale (\xe2\x80\x9cnot at all\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cless than usual\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cmore than usual\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9crather more than usual\xe2\x80\x9d). The six positive items were corrected. Participants who answered \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat more than usual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmore than usual\xe2\x80\x9d scored 1, while those who answered \xe2\x80\x9cless than usual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnot at all\xe2\x80\x9d scored 0 (the so-called \xe2\x80\x9c0-0-1-1 method\xe2\x80\x9d) (68). A total score ranged from 0 to 12 points; higher scores indicate worse health. The scale showed a good internal consistency (\xce\xb1 = 0.73).\r\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Knowledge of people (acquaintance, friend, relative) who had contracted COVID-19 and/or someone who had died from COVID-19.\r\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Compilation of a socio-demographic data sheet which was included in the questionnaire. The variables taken into consideration are: age, educational qualification, marital status, current job situation, people with the subject lives, children/no children, religious belief.\r\nThis is a multidisciplinary research which is part of a quantitative theoretical framework. As the data was collected during the lockdown, the questionnaire was administered online. The research was proposed via a link with access to the questionnaire sent by email, WhatsApp, discussion forums and social networks such as Facebook. The platform used for the questionnaire is Microsoft Forms. Before compiling, participants read the aims of the study, the themes proposed, the type of reconstruction, the informed consent stating that participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw at any time by closing the browser window. The inclusion criteria were being at least 18 years old and living in Italy during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic disease. The convenience sample was recruited through a random cascade sampling, starting from some subjects known by the research team. The research, having an exploratory character, does not want to restore a representative image of the Italian population but rather give a picture of the perceptions of the population during the lockdown in relation to their spiritual and mental health. The compilation of the protocol lasted on average about 22 min per participant.\r\nThe data were collected in compliance with the privacy and the research ethics code of the Italian Association of Psychology, after the protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Department of Education Sciences of the University of Genoa. The research lasted 10 days and was carried out after the first 2 weeks of lockdown. About two thirds of the questionnaires were compiled on the first day of the questionnaire launch, in line with recent and similar studies during the pandemic crisis (49, 69).\r\nA total of 1,250 adults from all over Italy participated in the on-line questionnaire. Most respondents were women (77.3%), young adults (age M = 42.6 years, SD = 15.7; range 19\xe2\x80\x9388), married or cohabiting with partner (48.3%) or single (41.5%), without children (54.71%), living in a large center (47.9%), employed or self-employed (53.2%), and high education levels (59.8% hold at least a University degree). Participants were born mostly in Italy (96.9%), with the rest indicating 23 different countries of birth. Ecuador, Germany and Romania were the most prevalent. In Table 2 we report the socio-demographic characteristics in detail.\r\nWith regard to religious belief, 40.9% of the participants declared that they were agnostic/atheist or did not have any religious beliefs; 57.4%, on the other hand, declared that they referred to a religious belief, of which the majority (53%) were Catholic Christians.\r\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for sociodemographic characteristics and information about variables, consisting of frequencies and percentages, while the scores of Jarel Spiritual Well-Being Scale (JSWB) and, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were expressed as means and standard deviations. Moreover, for JSWB and GHQ-12, skewness and kurtosis values were obtained, with no further interpretation due to the large sample size (70, 71). To investigate the dichotomic variable (gender differences, have children/no children, religious belief and the closeness with the COVID-19 disease such as knowing someone who was infected or died from coronavirus) in relation to JSWB and GHQ-12, t-tests were used for independent samples. To compare the differences between our participants and the Italian normative sample and therefore in relation to the pre-pandemic data for JSWB (45) and GHQ-12 (79), t-tests were conducted for single samples. While variance analysis was used to investigate the differences between groups (age, marital status, work situation, people lived with) in relation to JSWB and GHQ-12, with post-hoc Tukey (for homogeneous variances) or Games-Howell (for non-homogeneous variances) between group comparisons in case of a significant overall F-value. Appropriate effect size statistics that adjust for differences in group sizes were obtained of Cohen's d for t-tests and \xce\xb72 for ANOVAs. To explore the relationship between JSWB and GHQ-12 scales, correlation analyses (Pearson correlation coefficient r for GHQ-12 and JSWB and continuous variables) were conducted. We used multiple linear step way regressions to calculate the univariate associations between sociodemographic characteristics and JSWB and GHQ-12 scales. All tests were two-tailed, with a significance level of p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistic 18.0.\r\nIn Table 1, although not necessary given the size of the sample, the skewness and kurtosis analyses are reported, which show that there is a normal distribution of the data.\r\nTable 1. Skewness and Kurtosis values.\r\nSpiritual well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, measured through the JSWB scale, revealed a sample mean score of 52.64 (SD = 10.33, see Table 1). As regards the JSWB Faith and belief dimension the data shows an average of 17.05 (SD = 7.20); with regard to the Meaning of life dimension the average is 17.71 (SD = 3.8) and finally, with regard to the Quality of relationships the average is 18.03 (SD = 2.98).\r\nWhile the psychological impact, measured through the GHQ-12 scale, revealed a sample mean score of 6.35 (SD = 3.05; see Table 1). A total of 932 respondents (80.2%) showed common mental disorder, including adjustment disorders or stress reactions, therefore they were at risk of anxiety/depression (score \xe2\x89\xa54), while 230 (19.8%) reported a low psychological impact (score <4).\r\nRegarding the perceived level of spiritual well-being a significant difference between those who participated in the research (M = 52.64, SD = 10.33) and the normative sample emerged (M = 55.03, SD = 9.38) (t(1095) = \xe2\x88\x927.65, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.24) (45) (see Table 2). Also, with regard to mental health from a comparison with the normative sample (M = 1.80, SD = 2.3) (72) a significant difference emerges from the average obtained by the participants in the research (M = 6.35, SD = 3.05, t(1161) = 50.90, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.68) (see Table 2).\r\nTable 2. Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS) and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) comparison between participants and Italian normative sample.\r\nTable 3 shows the descriptive data for all demographic variables as well as the associations between such variables and Spiritual well-being and General Health. Women showed significantly higher levels in both variables.\r\nTable 3. Descriptive data for all demographic variables, associations between variables and Spiritual well-being and General Health.\r\nThrough the test for independent samples it emerged that there is a significant difference both as regards the Spiritual Well-Being Scale and as regards the GHQ-12 scale in relation to gender: in particular, as shown in the Table 3, it emerged that on average women perceive a higher level of spiritual well-being and a lower level of mental health than men.\r\nMoreover, through the univariate ANOVA it emerged that both as regards the JSWB scale (F(5, 1078) = 8.89, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.040) and as regards the GHQ-12 scale (F(5, 1144) = 6.20, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.026) there is a significant difference in relation to age; in fact, compared to the JSWB scale, post-hoc testing revealed significant differences between those aged 18\xe2\x80\x9324 (M = 49.94, DS = 9.80) and 25\xe2\x80\x9334 (M = 51.03, SD = 10.05) and those aged 45-54 (M = 55.64, DS = 9.82) and 55\xe2\x80\x9364 (M = 54.00, DS = 10.25), who have a higher level of spiritual well-being than those who are aged 18\xe2\x80\x9324 years. These findings indicated that younger participants have lower levels of spiritual well-being; also as regards the GHQ-12 scale, those aged between 18 and 24 (M = 7.35, SD = 3.05) have a statistically significant different level of perceived mental health compared to the other age groups (25\xe2\x80\x9334, 35\xe2\x80\x9344, 45\xe2\x80\x9354, 55\xe2\x80\x9364). These findings indicated that younger participants have a lower level of perceived mental health compared to the older participants.\r\nRegarding the educational qualification variable, no significant differences emerged either in relation to spiritual well-being or in relation to mental health.\r\nRegarding marital status, significant differences emerged both in the JSWB scale F(3, 1090) = 4.01, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2= 0.010, and in the GHQ-12 scale (F(3, 1157) = 8.00, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2= 0.020). Regarding the JSWB scale, post-hoc testing revealed significant differences between the unmarried (M = 51.55, SD = 10.64) and married or cohabiting (M = 53.65, SD = 10.11). These findings indicate that singles have a lower level of spiritual well-being than married or cohabiting participants. Also, for GHQ-12, post-hoc testing revealed significant differences between the unmarried (M = 6.85, SD = 3.04) and married or cohabiting participants (M = 6.01, SD = 2.97). These findings indicate that singles have a worse mental health than married participants.\r\nIn Table 4 we report the data for some relational variables and the two scales of Spiritual well-being and General Health.\r\nTable 4. Descriptive data for Socio-relational variables and associations between variables and Spiritual well-being and General Health.\r\nIn relation to the variable people with the subject lives F(3, 1083) =3.86, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2= 0.011, and work situation (F(2, 658) =8.38, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2= 0.025) significant differences emerge in the JSWB scale alone. Post-hoc testing revealed significant differences between those who live with friends and roommates (M = 49.04, SD = 9.86) and those who live alone (M = 53.67, SD = 10.85) or with families (M = 53.09, SD = 10.45). These findings indicate that those who live with friends or roommates have a lower level of spiritual well-being than those who live alone or in families. Instead, with regard to the work situation variable during the lockdown, post-hoc analysis showed that there is a significant difference between those who have jobs or are on layoffs (M = 50.36, SD = 9.55) and those in an unchanged work situation compared to before (M = 53.46, SD = 10.06) or working in smart working (M = 53.39, SD = 10.02). These findings indicate that those who lost their jobs or were laid off perceived a lower level of spiritual well-being than those in unchanged work situations or in smart working.\r\nConversely, there is no significant difference between the work situations and the perceived level of mental health.\r\nMoreover, with regard to the children/no children variable, those who do not have children declared a perceived worse mental health (GHQ-12) (M = 6.60, SD = 3.03) compared to those with children (M = 6.06, SD = 3.05) (t(1, 156) = 3, p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.27).\r\nFinally, with regard to the religious belief variable, the analysis carried out shows that between those who declared themselves as atheists/agnostics or with no religious belief and those who declared a religious belief there is no significant difference in the level of perceived mental health, while there is a significant difference with respect to the perceived level of spiritual well-being (those who declared themselves as atheists/agnostics or with no religious belief = M = 45.70, SD = 7.56, score lower than those who declared a religious belief = M = 57.85, SD = 8.95, t(1, 074) = \xe2\x88\x9224.24, p < 0.001, Cohen's d= 1.46).\r\nThe closeness with the COVID-19 disease variable is presented in Table 5.\r\nTable 5. Associations between \xe2\x80\x9cNo contact with COVID-19- contact with COVID-19\xe2\x80\x9d and Spiritual well-being and General Health.\r\nIt was verified that there is a significant difference between people who know someone who died from COVID-19 (18.8%) and who had no contact with COVID-19 (39.7%): in fact the results show that those who know people who died from COVID-19 perceive higher levels of spiritual well-being compared to those who have not had contact with COVID-19 (M = 53.81, SD = 10.42, M = 51.86, SD = 10.66, t(631) = \xe2\x88\x922.19, p < 0.05). It emerged, however, that in relation to this variable there are no significant differences as regards the GHQ-12 scale.\r\nFurther analyzes were made to understand how the sub-dimensions of Jarel Spiritual Well-Being affect demographic and socio-relational variables differently. Tables 6, 7 show only the significant analyzes in relation to these variables.\r\nTable 6. Descriptive data for Demographic variables and associations between variables and Spiritual well-being dimension: Faith and belief, Meaning of life, Quality of relationships.\r\nTable 7. Descriptive data for Socio relational variables and associations between variables and Spiritual well-being dimension: Faith and belief, Meaning of life, Quality of relationships.\r\nThe Table 6 shows how there is a significant difference in relation to gender regarding the dimension Faith and belief (t(1142) = \xe2\x88\x922.52, p < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.018): women perceive greater Faith and belief than men. Moreover, the table shows that both as regards the Faith and Belief dimension (F(5, 1147) = 8.20, p < 0.001, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.035) and as regards the Meaning of life (F(5, 1148) = 6.31, p < 0.001, \xce\xb7p2 =0.027) there is a significant difference in relation to age; in fact, compared to the Faith and Belief dimension, post-hoc testing revealed significant differences between those aged 18-24, 25-34 and those aged 45-54, 55-64, who have a higher level of Faith and belief and Meaning of life than those who are aged 18-24 and 25-34 years. These findings indicated that younger participants have lower levels of Faith and belief and Meaning of life.\r\nFinally, with regard to the marital status, the results highlight how there is a significant difference both as regards the Faith and belief dimension (F(3, 1159) = 3.07, p < 0.05, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.008), and the Meaning of life dimension (F(3, 1161) = 5.27, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.013): in particular from the post-hoc it emerges how those who are unmarried/single perceive a lower level of Faith and belief and Meaning of life than those who are married/cohabiting.\r\nWith regard to the socio-relational variables, the Table 7 shows that as regards the variable people with the subject lives, significant differences emerge in Meaning of life (F(3, 1154) = 4.57, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.012). As for the Meaning of life dimension, post-hoc show how those who live with friends and roommates perceive lower levels of Meaning of life than those who live alone, with family or with a partner.\r\nWith regard to the Current job situation variable, as reported in Table 7, a significant difference emerges in Faith and belief dimension (F(3, 706) = 4.94, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.014). From the post-hoc it emerges that those who have declared that their work situation has remained unchanged or have switched to smart-working perceive a higher level of Faith and belief than those who have lost their jobs or are on layoffs.\r\nRegarding the variable children (no children/children) significant differences emerge both in the dimension of Faith and belief (t(1159) = \xe2\x88\x924.63, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.27) and the dimension of Meaning of life (t(1160) = \xe2\x88\x924.053, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.24): those with children report higher levels of Faith and belief and Meaning of life than those who do not. Finally, with regard to the religious belief variable, from the t-test it emerges, as reported in Table 7, that there is a significant difference between those who declared to have a religious belief and those who do not with respect to all three dimensions: Faith and belief (t(1158) = \xe2\x88\x9236.33, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.16), Meaning of life (t(1156) = \xe2\x88\x924.91, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.29) and Quality of relationships (t(1168) = \xe2\x88\x922.02, p < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.12): those who have declared to have a religious belief perceive greater levels of Faith and belief, Meaning of life and Quality of relationships than those who have declared not to have religious belief.\r\nPearson's correlational analyses revealed that during the lockdown there was a positive correlation between the perception of spiritual well-being and the age of the participants: with increasing age of the participants, the perceived spiritual well-being increased (r = 0.153, p = 0.01). Furthermore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis has had a negative impact as regards mental health especially on younger people (r =-0.106, p = 0.01): in fact there is a negative relationship between the level of perceived mental health and the age of the participants: the risk of anxiety and stress decreases with increasing age. There is also a significant relationship between the GHQ-12 and the JSWB scale (r = \xe2\x88\x920.28, p < 0.05) and also in two of the three sub-dimensions, the Meaning of life (r = \xe2\x88\x920.17, p < 0.05) and Quality of relationships (r = \xe2\x88\x920.19, p < 0.05) in particular, there is a negative correlation between GHQ-12 and spiritual well-being: as perceived spiritual well-being decreases, perceived mental health malaise increases perceived by the participants, who are more at risk of anxiety and depression.\r\nFurther investigation highlighted the factors affecting Jarel Spiritual well-being and general health scale. The stepwise model selection in multiple linear regression analysis that considered JSWB scale as a dependent variable is presented in Table 8.\r\nTable 8. Regression model: Jarel spiritual well-being scale (JSWB) as dependent variable.\r\nThe model has an R2 = 0.062, which means that 6% of the variance in JSWB scale is explained by the model. The R2-value was statistically significant. Mental health seems to be the biggest predictor (\xc3\x9f = \xe2\x88\x920.621, p < 0.01). While age (\xc3\x9f = 0.097, p < 0.01) and gender (\xc3\x9f = 2.346, p < 0.01) are moderate predictors.\r\nTable 9 presents the stepwise model selection in multiple linear regression analysis, in which GHQ-12 was used as a dependent variable.\r\nTable 9. Regression model: General Health (GHQ-12) as dependent variable.\r\nThe model has an R2 = 0.04, which means that 4% of the variance in mental health is explained by the model. The R2-value was statistically significant. The JSWB scale seems to be the biggest predictor (\xc3\x9f = \xe2\x88\x920.059, p < 0.001). While gender (\xc3\x9f = 0.23, p < 0.001) is a moderate predictor.\r\nThis research, carried out during the lockdown period in Italy, has highlighted, in accordance with research carried out before the pandemic emergency event due to COVID-19 (19, 34, 34\xe2\x80\x9336, 41) how there is a connection between perceived spiritual well-being and mental and psychological health. Furthermore, the research by Gonz\xc3\xa1lez Sanguino et al. (73) has shown how spiritual well-being has been found to be a protective factor for depression and anxiety.\r\nThe data presented here show how our participants perceive both lower levels of spiritual well-being (45) and lower perception of positive mental health (72, 74) compared to the situation existing pre-pandemic. Furthermore, the period of the first lockdown in Italy seems to have had more significant effects on the mental health of the population than in other countries: Italians, in fact, record lower levels of mental health compared to those that emerged in a research conducted in the same period in the United Kingdom, where generalized lockdown was not in effect (75). However, these results are in line with previous research (76) which highlights how experiencing situations of crisis and bereavement can lead to the perception of poor spiritual well-being and greater psychological distress.\r\nWith regard to demographic variables, in relation to gender, it emerges that women perceive higher levels of spiritual well-being, in line with previous research (34, 45). In particular, women perceive greater Faith and belief than men. According to some authors, the higher scores of women's spiritual well-being could be linked to the fact that women have different experiences and coping strategies to men and also to the fact that religious norms and beliefs are more compatible with roles, characteristics and behaviors socially attributed to women (34, 77, 78). In relation, instead, to mental health, women show a lower perceived level of mental health, which confirms a constant of the previous literature (79\xe2\x80\x9381) and also relates to the period COVID-19 (49, 82\xe2\x80\x9384).\r\nWith regard to the age variable, the data showed that the younger participants (18\xe2\x80\x9324 years old) experienced a lower level of spiritual well-being, in particular Faith and belief and Meaning of life than people belonging to other age groups. In fact, from the literature it emerges that elderly people in particular benefit from religious practices and spiritual activities that positively affect their general well-being (3, 41).\r\nAlso, with regard to the perception of mental health, the data showed that the participants between 18 and 24 years old, the youngest participants, were the ones who were most affected by the lockdown situation, as also found in recent literature linked to the pandemic (85, 86). This condition of malaise could be due to the fact that young people suffered more from the lockdown restrictions because they are more used to living outside the home environment and according to Gonz\xc3\xa1lez-Sanguino et al. (73) this could also be due to the fact that younger participants have fewer resources and strategies to deal with crisis situations.\r\nWith regard to the marital status variable, the research also shows that singles have a lower level of spiritual well-being (in particular Faith and belief and Meaning of life) and mental health than those who are married or living together. This may be dictated by the fact that living as a couple can be considered a source of support in a lockdown situation in which social relations are limited to mere electronic contact (87, 88).\r\nAnalyzing the socio-relational variables, it emerged that those who live with friends and/or roommates perceive a lower level of spiritual well-being and in particular Meaning of life, than those who live alone or with family. This could also be due to age, a variable that was found to be negatively correlated with spiritual well-being; in fact, those who lived with friends or roommates were university students. Still in relation to the variable people with the subject lives, as regards mental health no significant differences emerged; this may be due to the fact that compared to the pre-pandemic period all the participants, regardless of the people they lived with during the lockdown, were significantly affected by the situation.\r\nInstead, in relation to the current job situation, it emerged that those who lost their jobs or had been laid off perceived lower levels of spiritual well-being, and in particular of Faith and belief, than those whose work situation had remained the same as before the lockdown or had switched to smart working. This is in line with that strand of literature which argues that people living in crisis situations perceive a low level of spiritual well-being (76). The fact that a difference with respect to mental health does not emerge may be due to the fact that the pandemic emergency situation led the participants to share the same destiny as regards their state of health, in which the working variable did not assume a significant weight at least in the initial stages of the emergency; an aspect that now, on the other hand, appears decidedly more salient and that the ever-increasing riots and protests in various countries are highlighting as a problematic condition.\r\nFurthermore, with respect to the children/no children variable, it emerged that those who do not have children perceive lower levels of spiritual well-being, in particular Faith and belief and Meaning of life than those who have children, this may be due to the fact that those who have children rely more on faith and spirituality. Carter (89) argues that for many families being involved in the congregation and their own spirituality are a source of strength, support and social support in the path of life together. Indeed, in the literature it has been found that the majority of families in the world, both within and beyond religious belief systems, use different forms of expression to satisfy their spiritual needs, particularly when facing adversity (20). Although spirituality and religion are two different constructs, literature shows strong correlations and overlaps; therefore, especially considering the high percentage of believers in our sample, it is evident that religion and church attendance in Italy, despite having decreased from the 1960s to today (90) still has a significant role and is probably even more fundamental for coping with this pandemic period (30), which may be more evident in families with children. Furthermore, the data also showed that those who do not have children have perceived lower levels of mental health than those who have.\r\nThis could be due to the fact that having to take care of a child leads to an increase in coping and resilience strategies, which positively affect psychological well-being (91). Furthermore, even though families faced numerous stresses during the lockdown (92, 93) they still reported a perception of greater mental health than singles who had to go through this period alone, in quarantine at home, inevitably perceiving less material and emotional support.\r\nFrom the analysis of the results, it also emerged that those who declared they had a religious belief perceived a higher level of spiritual well-being and reports higher levels in all its dimensions (Faith and belief, Meaning of life and Quality of relationships) than those who declared that they were atheist/agnostic or did not have a belief. This can be explained by the fact that, as previously seen, religion and spirituality are two closely related constructs (16\xe2\x80\x9318, 22) thus making it very likely that those who reported a religious belief benefited most in terms of perception of spiritual well-being. However, our data does not reveal a relationship between religious belief and mental health.\r\nThis finding is not confirmed in the research carried out in this pandemic situation by Pirutinsky et al. (37), who found that positive religious coping, intrinsic religiosity and trust in God were strongly correlated with less stress and more positive impact; Bentzen again (30), argues how people use religion to cope with the emotional stress caused by COVID-19, arguing how religiosity increases in response to unpredictable natural disasters, such as the COVID-19 crisis.\r\nWith respect to proximity to death, the data showed that those who know people who died from COVID-19 perceive higher levels of spiritual well-being precisely because, as also emerged in the literature (3, 7, 26), spirituality is considered a possible factor of resilience, which by positively affecting mental health, is crucial for those who are going through a grieving process, and who are also, in a similar situation, deprived of the possibility of implementing the typical rituals, such as the holding of funerals that were banned during the lockdown period, and which allowed people to accompany the deceased to burial, surrounded by the affection of friends and family and which contributed to the processing of the loss and mourning itself (13, 63).\r\nFinally, just as also found in the literature (3, 30, 34, 35, 41) the data showed that there is a relationship between spiritual well-being and mental health: from the analysis, in fact, it emerged that those who reported a lower level of spiritual well-being perceived a worse level of mental health. Finally, with regard to spiritual well-being, the data showed that mental health is the major predictor, while gender and age are moderate predictors. In fact, as also seen from the data reported previously and from the literature, age (3) and gender (34) have a significant impact on the perception of spiritual well-being.\r\nMental health, on the other hand, appears to be affected to a greater extent by spiritual well-being and to a lesser extent by gender. These data are confirmed by previous research which highlighted how spirituality and religious practices are a protective factor and closely connected to physical and mental health (3, 35, 41), as well as being a source of physical and psychological resilience (7, 39) and helping the development of coping strategies in people who experienced stressful life situations (34, 41), mitigating mood disorders such as depression and anxiety (19, 39).\r\nThe data presented give us a significant picture of the mental health situation experienced by the Italian population during the first lockdown and confirm the value of spiritual well-being as a protective factor of people's general well-being. However, we would like to outline some limitations of the research. Due to the contextual situation that involved a forced physical distance, the online questionnaire method seemed, despite the limits that this entails, the only possible strategy to reach a large number of subjects. Some limitations of the online questionnaire include the non-completion rate caused by the lower level of engagement than the paper questionnaire and the high number of questionnaires in circulation; moreover, a bias may be dictated by the type of careless response also highlighted in the literature (94). This choice of data collection was also confirmed by other researchers in relation to the COVID-19 epidemic (82). Furthermore, another limit, again related to data collection, is the type of sampling used: a random cascade sampling. Despite the research team's efforts to reach a large and diverse number of participants, use of the online questionnaire may not have allowed the involvement of some target populations. In spite of the weaknesses highlighted, this work has among its strengths the fact of being one of the first research studies conducted on the lockdown period related to COVID-19 in Italy which tries to investigate the role of spiritual well-being and its effects on individual well-being in the population with a multidisciplinary approach. This distance also led to a change in the outlook of some disciplines with a predominantly ethnographic approach, to try to get closer to the issues dealt with in a period such as that of the lockdown in which it was important that research continued to have its role of investigating and seeking knowledge despite non-essential activities having been stopped.\r\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, people and families experienced a new and sudden situation that forced them to stay indoors for a long period of time. In this context, many people and their families experienced situations of great discomfort, stress and fear related not only to the fear of contagion but also to the economic difficulties for those who saw their income reduced due to the closure of production activities or who experienced situations of loneliness, isolation or conflicts within the home. The pandemic has profoundly changed the way of life in society, starting from the need for \xe2\x80\x9csocial distancing\xe2\x80\x9d even among close relatives (87).\r\nIn this context it is very interesting to investigate if and how spirituality has been a form of emotional and psychological support useful for dealing with the loss and anguish of critical moments in life like this. This appears particularly dramatic for the families of those who died in hospital without being able to have their loved ones near them and without the latter being able to celebrate the funeral rites. The data from our study show that in the period of the lockdown those who were able to count on important forms of religiosity and spirituality drew mental well-being from these beliefs. Spirituality helped them to make sense of what was happening and not to feel lost in the face of the radical change in the way of living and conducting social relationships.\r\nLoss, grief, mental health, and spiritual well-being emerge as familiar themes in the lives of many individuals, families, and communities in different contexts. According to Zhai and Du (13) recognizing these individual experiences can enable healthcare professionals to develop personalized strategies to facilitate better adaptation to the situation and therefore promote mental health.\r\nIf looked at from the point of view of clinical practice, therefore, it can be seen that dealing with spirituality becomes fundamental; in fact, this aspect needs to be considered to really provide adequate support to individuals, especially those who manifest themselves as strong and solid.\r\nIn this regard, the consideration of spiritual needs is necessary to provide a holistic and people-centered intervention (95). By spiritual needs we mean everything that refers to the need to find meaning, value in one's life, peace and a sense of connection. These needs are not necessarily exclusively religious, even those who do not have a religious faith still refer to belief systems that provide feelings of meaning and purpose (46) which in this period of the COVID-19 pandemic seem to assume a role and an even deeper meaning in relation to the bewilderment that people are confronted with in the face of such a pervasive, disruptive event creating fragility, fear and daily uncertainties.\r\nIn a certain sense it is precisely at the moment of greatest difficulty that the need for support in spiritual terms becomes stronger, in the hope of finding comfort in one's faith and beliefs. Very often, however, we are faced with inadequate preparation in responding to this type of need (96). In fact, the importance of training health professionals so that they possess the skills to identify and support the spiritual discomfort of patients is increasingly evident (97). A distress which can lead to suffering, a state of anguish due to not being able to feel meaning in life in particular adverse moments, which in some way undermines personal identity (47, 48). Addressing psychosocial and spiritual needs can really contribute to the improvement (98) in the quality of life and well-being of individuals, especially at a time like the one the whole world is now facing and in which diagnostic and medical certainties become increasingly unsure and unconsolidated.\r\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\r\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Department of Education Sciences of the University of Genoa.

In this context, many people found themselves in great difficulty, not only because of the fear of contagion or the economic problems deriving from the closure of production activities but also because the virus profoundly changed the way of life in society. The \xe2\x80\x9cSocial distancing\xe2\x80\x9d concept became central in all personal relationships, including close family relationships. In this situation, our paper seeks to understand the role of spirituality and religiosity in reacting to this difficult situation and in particular on the physical and psychological health of the people involved. The data we present here are part of a multidisciplinary research with a quantitative theoretical framework. As the data was collected during the first Italian lockdown, a total of 1,250 adults from all over Italy participated in the on-line questionnaire. Among the main results it emerged that the participants perceived lower levels of spiritual well-being and mental health than the pre-pandemic situation with a significant gender difference; in fact, women perceived lower mental health than men. At the same time, it is evident that spirituality and religious practices are a protective factor connected not only with psychological and mental but also physical health. Finally, it appears evident that the family is a protective factor with respect to mental health, even in a period so full of stress factors, those who did not live alone and especially those who had to take care of small children reported higher perceived mental health and a greater ability to activate coping resources.\r\nThe catastrophic and unstoppable nature of COVID-19 has produced a series of devastating effects from an economic, social and psychological point of view at a global level. At different times and with different strategies, the whole world is tackling the challenges dictated by the pandemic, implementing physical distancing and the partial or general closure of shops, sports centers, schools, community centers and religious institutions, also encouraging, where possible, smart-working (1). In this way, points of reference and crucial meeting places for socialization and also for the performance of religious functions, which are such necessary pillars for mutual support in general, and even more fundamental in this complex period, have been lacking. Despite this, the population, demonstrating resilience and marked adaptation skills, immediately implemented compensatory strategies to cope with the social isolation into which they were forced: in fact, innumerable initiatives were created online to offer solidarity physical, psychological and spiritual well-being. Online communities came together to practice recreational, sports and spiritual-religious activities \xe2\x80\x9ctogether.\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, Yang et al., for example, argue how the use of 360\xc2\xb0 virtual tour offer a tourist experience in a moment in which the directives are to stay at home; this type of activity can, therefore, help reduce the stress caused by the pandemic (2).\r\nThese activities, particularly of a religious nature, made it possible to reduce the physical distances imposed by forced isolation without putting people's health at risk (3, 4), helping to reduce the negative effects of isolation, particularly in older people (5, 6). For many people, spiritual and religious practices give meaning, purpose and constitute a supportive community (7, 8). While, on the one hand the online initiatives managed to mitigate the negative effects of this situation, on the other, the restrictions adopted, while managing to slow down the infection, did not lead to the reduction of deaths, at least in some areas of the world where they continue to be high: today there are 1.18 million victims worldwide, of which 277.135 in Europe alone and unfortunately the statistics vary considerably day after day (9).\r\nAlthough death is the natural conclusion of the life cycle, the suddenness of this event, its mass diffusion and the consequent interruption of socially shared funeral rituals and practices, on the other hand, have certainly limited the functional capacity of the victims' relatives to process death (10, 11); this has contributed to prolonged pain, thus increasing the risk of complicated bereavement (10) which can result in prolonged bereavement disorder (12). This situation has undoubtedly contributed to compromising essential areas of mental and physical functioning (13).\r\nAs Thun\xc3\xa8-Boyle et al. (14) underline, religion and spirituality appear as parts of the same chromatic scale. Although religion and spirituality represent, in fact, two different constructs, they are nevertheless strictly interconnected and difficult to separate (15). Furthermore, the literature highlights how they are the reference point for the life of many people, especially in times of difficulty (16\xe2\x80\x9320). Religiosity has been defined as a multidimensional construct, oriented toward institutions and traditions (21), considered as a system of beliefs and practices (22) and defined by norms, rules, dogmas and rituals, uniting people who share the same creed (18).\r\nMany authors have highlighted how those who are faced with adverse personal life situations such as a disease like cancer (23, 24) or the death of a loved one (25\xe2\x80\x9327), particularly troubled migration paths (28, 29) or events involving the wider community such as earthquakes, tsunamis (30) tend to be more religious. As reported by Galen (31), the effects of religiosity on well-being seem to be related more to social support, a healthy lifestyle and the idea of existential certainty, than to the religious content of the beliefs in themselves; it would seem, in fact, that a large part of the advantage of religious individuals derives from being members of social groups. Spirituality, on the other hand, is seen as a more intimate dimension (18), a larger construct, an individual effort to discover the sacred or meaning of life (22) without confessional constraints (21, 32). Furthermore, it is defined by Puchalski et al. (33) as essential for humanity, a dimension, therefore, which contains within it philosophical, cultural and religious beliefs and practices.\r\nSpirituality, a source of comfort, support and meaning (7), instills the idea of a sense of belonging and existential interconnectedness, promoting mental health (34). In the literature, in fact, the accent has been placed on the association that exists between having spirituality and having a greater perception of well-being, physical and mental health (7, 19, 34, 34\xe2\x80\x9337). A particularly important aspect is related to coping, or the function performed by spiritual well-being in the management of stressful events. Spiritual coping can be understood as cognitive and behavioral efforts to find or maintain meaning, purpose and connection in the face of difficult situations (38).\r\nFurthermore, some authors over the years have argued that faith and spirituality can also be perceived as a source of resilience both from a physical, psychological and mental point of view (7, 39).\r\nEspecially in stressful situations, faith and spirituality seem to also act positively (3, 40, 41) on the immune system, particularly for older people (3, 40) who are also those most involved in religious and/or spiritual activities (15). Furthermore, spiritual well-being is defined as a state that connects the mind and body of the individual, society, intelligence and health, supporting the individual in his/her attitudes and life goals (42). According to Ellison (43), moreover, spiritual well-being includes both a psycho-social dimension and a more religious dimension, a unifying force that aims to integrate the physical, emotional and social dimensions of health. A study by Saiz et al. (44) demonstrated that spirituality in people with heart failure has broader associations with measures of psychosocial and physical symptoms than belonging to a religious organization and that religious affiliation alone did not emerge as a reliable predictor for health benefits. Indeed, it was even counterproductive: in fact they found that those who belonged to a religious organization, but with a low level of spirituality, perceived a state of anxiety and greater emotional fatigue. The literature also highlights how spiritual well-being is significantly higher in women than in men (34, 45).\r\nClosely connected to spiritual well-being, there are spiritual needs, which include everything that refers to the need to find meaning, value in one's life, peace and a sense of connection. These needs are not necessarily exclusively religious; in fact, even those who do not have a religious faith still refer to systems of beliefs that provide feelings of meaning and purpose (46). In this period of the COVID-19 pandemic they seem to assume a role and an even deeper meaning in relation to the bewilderment that people are confronted with when faced with such a pervasive, disruptive event, creating daily fragility, fear and uncertainty. In particular, the spiritual distress in those people going through adverse situations, such as that caused by COVID-19, should not be underestimated. By spiritual distress we mean suffering connected to the impossibility of feeling meaning in life, a state of anguish that occurs when an individual experience suffering that in some way undermines their personal identity, for example by raising existential questions about the reason for that particular suffering (47, 48).\r\nReligion and spirituality, therefore, are particularly fundamental and worthy of study in this highly complex period: COVID-19 and its physical, social and psychological consequences represent a challenge for the mental well-being of the entire world population (37, 49).\r\nIn contemporary society characterized by a process of individualization of subjects who experience a social condition of extreme loneliness, as well as isolation, the experience of death is also progressively isolated (50) when not, tragically, removed (51, 52). There are many strategies for concealing death, some are its spectacularization and mediatic overexposure (51), others offer the solution of a \xe2\x80\x9ccosmic\xe2\x80\x9d death (52). In the latter case, the anguish of death is resolved by removing it from the individual experience. Elias (50) underlines how the loneliness of the dying person begins with their progressive isolation and has, among its consequences, the loss of the ability to empathize both with the suffering and the mourning event. In a certain sense, death is no longer part of contemporary society, which prefers to represent itself in the power of youth frozen in suspended time.\r\nEach society has tried and tries to make sense of the human story starting from the most tragic experience of the end, which interrupts the flow of earthly life, as we know it. For many scholars, the experience of death is the central cultural theme of various societies, from ancient (53) to contemporary (54) to peasant societies in southern Italy (51). Specifically, the rituals of death give meaning to the cultural representations of the living-dead relationship (51), which are expressed through rituals organized in different practices, temporalities and aesthetics (55, 56) but all marked by the centrality of the body of the deceased and of the community committed to overcoming the mourning event.\r\nThe cultural shaping of this event, through the ritual that accompanies mourning, serves to allow the passage of the dead from the world of the living to the afterlife and, at the same time, guarantees the recovery of the community of the living (51, 57). In this perspective, the importance of the celebration of rites and of the community dimension of this celebration is clear, with a progression from the family community of loved ones (51, 55, 57) up to including the collectivity of acquaintances or an entire community. Ultimately, the death rituals that accompany mourning allow us to transcend the risk of a second and more tragic death, namely the risk for survivors of getting entangled in the mournful tragedy of the loss of a loved one and forever losing their ability to \xe2\x80\x9cBe stronger in the world\xe2\x80\x9d the closer they were to the missing person (57).\r\nLoewenthal and Dein (58) emphasize how religious rituals offer a range of positive mental health benefits, from reduced anxiety to meaning in life and a sense of community. Moreover, as reported by Willard et al. (59), institutional religious practices sometimes affect subjective well-being even more than personal belief or individual spirituality. Finally, the lack of rituals can compromise the ability to connect with the deceased (10), strongly affecting the restoration of well-being in those who remain and who must face mourning their loss without moments of sharing with a wider relational network. which can offer support. \xe2\x80\x9cThe absence of ritual, such as a funeral, often results in disenfranchised grief, and lacking social or cultural recognition impairs support resources that assist the grieving process\xe2\x80\x9d [(13). p. 80]. The process of mourning requires a complex convergence of affective responses, cognitive, behavioral, physical and spiritual adaptations that take shape through rituals and flow into an individualized equilibrium that is a source of well-being.\r\nThe pandemic has produced a shock of reality, progressively exposing us to the awareness of an extreme risk, that of death, as a collective community experience, typical of situations of war and natural catastrophes, as opposed to an individual one, in which the experience of passing away acquired the tragedy of an individual and family history.\r\nThe death curve in the representation of the disease by experts has become the daily account of the pandemic. In just 1 day, on March 28, 2020, in Lombardy alone, the most affected region of northern Italy, there were 542 deaths from COVID-19. The idea of the end took possession of us with an unprecedented emotional impact through the images from the city of Bergamo, the epicenter of one of the worst affected areas of Italy, of the dead closed in anonymous coffins, without names, without flowers, lined up in church on their last journey in solitude to the afterlife. Coffins, also in Bergamo, transported on military trucks in convoy through the streets of the deserted city, where the living were forced to stay at home, experiencing physical and spiritual distancing from loved ones who were denied the last farewell, so as to safeguard public health, eliminating the rite of the public and collective funeral that restores humanity to such a painful moment for families.\r\nAbove all, the silence and emptiness in which this convoy took place was striking. The sense of suspension of time, of loneliness, of lack of reality burst into our lives through the images that came to us from TV and social media and embody that fear, which progressively, starting from the onset of the pandemic, has turned into terror and bewilderment. The pandemic, from being a word of difficult scientific meanings, now acquires a precise, full and absolute meaning: Death.\r\nThe people who die, as well as the people who remain, relatives, family members, friends and the many spectators who feel part of an \xe2\x80\x9cexistential community of destiny\xe2\x80\x9d (60), are all condemned to isolation, besides loneliness, faced with the triumph of the deadly virus. According to Migliorati (61), death in the first period of the pandemic broke out as \xe2\x80\x9caseptic death,\xe2\x80\x9d separated from the individual experience and projected into an anonymous dimension of collective death. In the first period of lockdown, in fact, the dead and their relatives were out of the narrative. In this way, the narrative of death reduced the mournful event, albeit in its tragic nature, to a \xe2\x80\x9cside effect\xe2\x80\x9d of the pandemic, one of the many dimensions, perhaps even negligible. After all, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are all elderly, the average age is 81 years old, they all had previous pathologies\xe2\x80\x9d [(61). p 40]. The most effective symbolic image of this narrative was the juxtaposition between COVID-19 and war. The pandemic was recounted as a war with its victims (especially the elderly), its heroes (especially the health personnel), its generals, ready to save us with their field strategies (the government, virologists, experts). In short, in the pandemic, death essentially broke into an interpretative scheme that saw a shift of death along the nature-culture continuum toward nature in the sign of the removal of the corpse, away from culture, capable of transcending death through ritual (57).\r\nWhat happens when funerals are suspended? When the dead and their relatives go through the tragic passing alone? Because this is what happened during the lockdown in Italy: the dead were taken away alone, without a worthy accompaniment, and the living locked in their homes could not meet for worthy rituals that could ease that sudden and devastating pain and share it with people who cared. Thus, it follows that pain has no right of expression through those socially and culturally shared rituals (13); and it is precisely the absence of rituals that contributes to aggravating both the experience of mourning (13, 62) and the feelings of guilt and responsibility dictated by the conflict between what the victim's wishes were and what the state allowed (63).\r\nThe experience of death during COVID-19 goes far beyond situations of death by natural catastrophe in which the bodies are missing. In our case the relatives, reduced to members of the larger community that mourned their dead, witness the death of loved ones shut away in their homes. The tragedy of the suspension of rituals in the period of COVID-19 crossed with the tragedy of having to overcome the event alone, at home.\r\nThe pandemic has pushed the condition of loneliness, not only of the dying but also of the relatives, toward the most tragic of its epilogs. Experiments were attempted to alleviate the sense of loneliness and isolation in the face of death. For example, the creativity of a hospital chaplain in one of the most affected cities in northern Italy (Bergamo) allowed many relatives to participate remotely in the funeral ceremony via mobile phones. A coffin, a parish priest, a cell phone. All that remains of funeral participation in a period of forced isolation and media coverage of reality. As Dei (64) states \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the most inhuman aspect of this experiment of suspended sociality to which we are forced, even more cruel than the dystopian imaginary fanned by those philosophers who fear our reduction to bare life, is the denial of the rituals appointed to accompany the condolences\xe2\x80\x9d [(64). p 2].\r\nA cruelty that became more and more specific in the tragedy of a mourning event suspended, not overcome, entangled in the event of death, when with the passing of the weeks, toward the end of the lockdown period, from the indistinct magma of a collective death the personal stories, the family tragedies, the many faces of the dead and the remaining relatives emerged. At this point it was clear that the patriotic community which mourns its dead is unable to give meaning to the pain of the proximate community of family members, friends for the loss of a loved one.\r\nGiven the large number of people infected and of deaths in Italy caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this research focuses on the spiritual well-being and psychological impact of the general population during the lockdown. We believe that is important to deepen our knowledge of the perception of spiritual well-being and mental health so as to develop interventions and support people, to be ready for similar future events in order to reduce the negative consequences of a possible second wave of the virus.\r\nWe wish to pursue two main objectives. The first is to further investigate how spiritual well-being dimension was faced by Italian adults during the first weeks of lockdown subsequent to the COVID-19 outbreak. The second is to explore psychological mental health in terms of the psychological impact of the pandemic. We also set out to analyze if there were differences in the perception of spiritual well-being and mental health compared to the pre-pandemic data in the general population. The relationships between spiritual and psychological aspects were also investigated and how these two dimensions are associated with demographic variables (such as age, gender, level of education, marital status), socio-relational variables (such as people lived with, work situation, presence of children, religious beliefs) and the nearness with the COVID-19 disease, for example knowing someone who was infected or who died of coronavirus. We also assume that as spiritual well-being increases the perception of positive mental health increases and that socio-demographic variables, such as gender and age affect spiritual well-being and mental health.\r\nThe protocol included some questions created ad hoc by the research team following several focus groups, which made it possible to identify the areas to be investigated, listed below:\r\nSpiritual well-being: Jarel Spiritual Well-Being Scale (JSWB) (65, 66). Italian version validated by Magnano et al. (45) composed of 21 items with a five-point Likert scale from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree. The scale is composed of three factors: Faith and belief (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cPrayer is an important part of my life\xe2\x80\x9d), Meaning of life (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9cI find meaning and purpose in my life\xe2\x80\x9d), and Quality of relationships (I am able to appreciate differences in others). The scale showed a good internal consistency (\xce\xb1 = 0.82). The higher the scores, the greater the spiritual well-being.\r\nMental health: General Health Questionnaire-12 items (GHQ-12): this scale measures the state of mental health over the past few weeks and was developed by Goldberg in the 70s and validated in Italy by Piccinelli et al. (67). The 12-item version, GHQ-12, was the most widely used (68). Participants had to report whether they experienced a particular symptom of mental distress according to a four-point Likert-type scale (\xe2\x80\x9cnot at all\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cless than usual\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cmore than usual\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9crather more than usual\xe2\x80\x9d). The six positive items were corrected. Participants who answered \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat more than usual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmore than usual\xe2\x80\x9d scored 1, while those who answered \xe2\x80\x9cless than usual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnot at all\xe2\x80\x9d scored 0 (the so-called \xe2\x80\x9c0-0-1-1 method\xe2\x80\x9d) (68). A total score ranged from 0 to 12 points; higher scores indicate worse health. The scale showed a good internal consistency (\xce\xb1 = 0.73).\r\nKnowledge of people (acquaintance, friend, relative) who had contracted COVID-19 and/or someone who had died from COVID-19.\r\nCompilation of a socio-demographic data sheet which was included in the questionnaire. The variables taken into consideration are: age, educational qualification, marital status, current job situation, people with the subject lives, children/no children, religious belief.\r\nThis is a multidisciplinary research which is part of a quantitative theoretical framework. As the data was collected during the lockdown, the questionnaire was administered online. The research was proposed via a link with access to the questionnaire sent by email, WhatsApp, discussion forums and social networks such as Facebook. The platform used for the questionnaire is Microsoft Forms. Before compiling, participants read the aims of the study, the themes proposed, the type of reconstruction, the informed consent stating that participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw at any time by closing the browser window. The inclusion criteria were being at least 18 years old and living in Italy during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic disease. The convenience sample was recruited through a random cascade sampling, starting from some subjects known by the research team. The research, having an exploratory character, does not want to restore a representative image of the Italian population but rather give a picture of the perceptions of the population during the lockdown in relation to their spiritual and mental health. The compilation of the protocol lasted on average about 22 min per participant.\r\nThe data were collected in compliance with the privacy and the research ethics code of the Italian Association of Psychology, after the protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Department of Education Sciences of the University of Genoa. The research lasted 10 days and was carried out after the first 2 weeks of lockdown. About two thirds of the questionnaires were compiled on the first day of the questionnaire launch, in line with recent and similar studies during the pandemic crisis (49, 69).\r\nA total of 1,250 adults from all over Italy participated in the on-line questionnaire. Most respondents were women (77.3%), young adults (age M = 42.6 years, SD = 15.7; range 19\xe2\x80\x9388), married or cohabiting with partner (48.3%) or single (41.5%), without children (54.71%), living in a large center (47.9%), employed or self-employed (53.2%), and high education levels (59.8% hold at least a University degree). Participants were born mostly in Italy (96.9%), with the rest indicating 23 different countries of birth. Ecuador, Germany and Romania were the most prevalent. In Table 2 we report the socio-demographic characteristics in detail.\r\nWith regard to religious belief, 40.9% of the participants declared that they were agnostic/atheist or did not have any religious beliefs; 57.4%, on the other hand, declared that they referred to a religious belief, of which the majority (53%) were Catholic Christians.\r\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for sociodemographic characteristics and information about variables, consisting of frequencies and percentages, while the scores of Jarel Spiritual Well-Being Scale (JSWB) and, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were expressed as means and standard deviations. Moreover, for JSWB and GHQ-12, skewness and kurtosis values were obtained, with no further interpretation due to the large sample size (70, 71). To investigate the dichotomic variable (gender differences, have children/no children, religious belief and the closeness with the COVID-19 disease such as knowing someone who was infected or died from coronavirus) in relation to JSWB and GHQ-12, t-tests were used for independent samples. To compare the differences between our participants and the Italian normative sample and therefore in relation to the pre-pandemic data for JSWB (45) and GHQ-12 (79), t-tests were conducted for single samples. While variance analysis was used to investigate the differences between groups (age, marital status, work situation, people lived with) in relation to JSWB and GHQ-12, with post-hoc Tukey (for homogeneous variances) or Games-Howell (for non-homogeneous variances) between group comparisons in case of a significant overall F-value. Appropriate effect size statistics that adjust for differences in group sizes were obtained of Cohen's d for t-tests and \xce\xb72 for ANOVAs. To explore the relationship between JSWB and GHQ-12 scales, correlation analyses (Pearson correlation coefficient r for GHQ-12 and JSWB and continuous variables) were conducted. We used multiple linear step way regressions to calculate the univariate associations between sociodemographic characteristics and JSWB and GHQ-12 scales. All tests were two-tailed, with a significance level of p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistic 18.0.\r\nIn Table 1, although not necessary given the size of the sample, the skewness and kurtosis analyses are reported, which show that there is a normal distribution of the data.\r\nSkewness and Kurtosis values.\r\nSpiritual well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, measured through the JSWB scale, revealed a sample mean score of 52.64 (SD = 10.33, see Table 1). As regards the JSWB Faith and belief dimension the data shows an average of 17.05 (SD = 7.20); with regard to the Meaning of life dimension the average is 17.71 (SD = 3.8) and finally, with regard to the Quality of relationships the average is 18.03 (SD = 2.98).\r\nWhile the psychological impact, measured through the GHQ-12 scale, revealed a sample mean score of 6.35 (SD = 3.05; see Table 1). A total of 932 respondents (80.2%) showed common mental disorder, including adjustment disorders or stress reactions, therefore they were at risk of anxiety/depression (score \xe2\x89\xa54), while 230 (19.8%) reported a low psychological impact (score <4).\r\nRegarding the perceived level of spiritual well-being a significant difference between those who participated in the research (M = 52.64, SD = 10.33) and the normative sample emerged (M = 55.03, SD = 9.38) (t(1095) = \xe2\x88\x927.65, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.24) (45) (see Table 2). Also, with regard to mental health from a comparison with the normative sample (M = 1.80, SD = 2.3) (72) a significant difference emerges from the average obtained by the participants in the research (M = 6.35, SD = 3.05, t(1161) = 50.90, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.68) (see Table 2).\r\nSpiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS) and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) comparison between participants and Italian normative sample.\r\nTable 3 shows the descriptive data for all demographic variables as well as the associations between such variables and Spiritual well-being and General Health. Women showed significantly higher levels in both variables.\r\nDescriptive data for all demographic variables, associations between variables and Spiritual well-being and General Health.\r\nThrough the test for independent samples it emerged that there is a significant difference both as regards the Spiritual Well-Being Scale and as regards the GHQ-12 scale in relation to gender: in particular, as shown in the Table 3, it emerged that on average women perceive a higher level of spiritual well-being and a lower level of mental health than men.\r\nMoreover, through the univariate ANOVA it emerged that both as regards the JSWB scale (F(5, 1078) = 8.89, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.040) and as regards the GHQ-12 scale (F(5, 1144) = 6.20, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.026) there is a significant difference in relation to age; in fact, compared to the JSWB scale, post-hoc testing revealed significant differences between those aged 18\xe2\x80\x9324 (M = 49.94, DS = 9.80) and 25\xe2\x80\x9334 (M = 51.03, SD = 10.05) and those aged 45-54 (M = 55.64, DS = 9.82) and 55\xe2\x80\x9364 (M = 54.00, DS = 10.25), who have a higher level of spiritual well-being than those who are aged 18\xe2\x80\x9324 years. These findings indicated that younger participants have lower levels of spiritual well-being; also as regards the GHQ-12 scale, those aged between 18 and 24 (M = 7.35, SD = 3.05) have a statistically significant different level of perceived mental health compared to the other age groups (25\xe2\x80\x9334, 35\xe2\x80\x9344, 45\xe2\x80\x9354, 55\xe2\x80\x9364). These findings indicated that younger participants have a lower level of perceived mental health compared to the older participants.\r\nRegarding the educational qualification variable, no significant differences emerged either in relation to spiritual well-being or in relation to mental health.\r\nRegarding marital status, significant differences emerged both in the JSWB scale F(3, 1090) = 4.01, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2= 0.010, and in the GHQ-12 scale (F(3, 1157) = 8.00, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2= 0.020). Regarding the JSWB scale, post-hoc testing revealed significant differences between the unmarried (M = 51.55, SD = 10.64) and married or cohabiting (M = 53.65, SD = 10.11). These findings indicate that singles have a lower level of spiritual well-being than married or cohabiting participants. Also, for GHQ-12, post-hoc testing revealed significant differences between the unmarried (M = 6.85, SD = 3.04) and married or cohabiting participants (M = 6.01, SD = 2.97). These findings indicate that singles have a worse mental health than married participants.\r\nIn Table 4 we report the data for some relational variables and the two scales of Spiritual well-being and General Health.\r\nDescriptive data for Socio-relational variables and associations between variables and Spiritual well-being and General Health.\r\nIn relation to the variable people with the subject lives F(3, 1083) =3.86, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2= 0.011, and work situation (F(2, 658) =8.38, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2= 0.025) significant differences emerge in the JSWB scale alone. Post-hoc testing revealed significant differences between those who live with friends and roommates (M = 49.04, SD = 9.86) and those who live alone (M = 53.67, SD = 10.85) or with families (M = 53.09, SD = 10.45). These findings indicate that those who live with friends or roommates have a lower level of spiritual well-being than those who live alone or in families. Instead, with regard to the work situation variable during the lockdown, post-hoc analysis showed that there is a significant difference between those who have jobs or are on layoffs (M = 50.36, SD = 9.55) and those in an unchanged work situation compared to before (M = 53.46, SD = 10.06) or working in smart working (M = 53.39, SD = 10.02). These findings indicate that those who lost their jobs or were laid off perceived a lower level of spiritual well-being than those in unchanged work situations or in smart working.\r\nConversely, there is no significant difference between the work situations and the perceived level of mental health.\r\nMoreover, with regard to the children/no children variable, those who do not have children declared a perceived worse mental health (GHQ-12) (M = 6.60, SD = 3.03) compared to those with children (M = 6.06, SD = 3.05) (t(1, 156) = 3, p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.27).\r\nFinally, with regard to the religious belief variable, the analysis carried out shows that between those who declared themselves as atheists/agnostics or with no religious belief and those who declared a religious belief there is no significant difference in the level of perceived mental health, while there is a significant difference with respect to the perceived level of spiritual well-being (those who declared themselves as atheists/agnostics or with no religious belief = M = 45.70, SD = 7.56, score lower than those who declared a religious belief = M = 57.85, SD = 8.95, t(1, 074) = \xe2\x88\x9224.24, p < 0.001, Cohen's d= 1.46).\r\nThe closeness with the COVID-19 disease variable is presented in Table 5.\r\nAssociations between \xe2\x80\x9cNo contact with COVID-19- contact with COVID-19\xe2\x80\x9d and Spiritual well-being and General Health.\r\nIt was verified that there is a significant difference between people who know someone who died from COVID-19 (18.8%) and who had no contact with COVID-19 (39.7%): in fact the results show that those who know people who died from COVID-19 perceive higher levels of spiritual well-being compared to those who have not had contact with COVID-19 (M = 53.81, SD = 10.42, M = 51.86, SD = 10.66, t(631) = \xe2\x88\x922.19, p < 0.05). It emerged, however, that in relation to this variable there are no significant differences as regards the GHQ-12 scale.\r\nFurther analyzes were made to understand how the sub-dimensions of Jarel Spiritual Well-Being affect demographic and socio-relational variables differently. Tables 6, \xe2\x80\x8b,77 show only the significant analyzes in relation to these variables.\r\nDescriptive data for Demographic variables and associations between variables and Spiritual well-being dimension: Faith and belief, Meaning of life, Quality of relationships.\r\nThe table shows only the significant analyzes in relation to the variables considered.\r\nDescriptive data for Socio relational variables and associations between variables and Spiritual well-being dimension: Faith and belief, Meaning of life, Quality of relationships.\r\nThe table shows only the significant analyzes in relation to the variables considered.\r\nThe Table 6 shows how there is a significant difference in relation to gender regarding the dimension Faith and belief (t(1142) = \xe2\x88\x922.52, p < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.018): women perceive greater Faith and belief than men. Moreover, the table shows that both as regards the Faith and Belief dimension (F(5, 1147) = 8.20, p < 0.001, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.035) and as regards the Meaning of life (F(5, 1148) = 6.31, p < 0.001, \xce\xb7p2 =0.027) there is a significant difference in relation to age; in fact, compared to the Faith and Belief dimension, post-hoc testing revealed significant differences between those aged 18-24, 25-34 and those aged 45-54, 55-64, who have a higher level of Faith and belief and Meaning of life than those who are aged 18-24 and 25-34 years. These findings indicated that younger participants have lower levels of Faith and belief and Meaning of life.\r\nFinally, with regard to the marital status, the results highlight how there is a significant difference both as regards the Faith and belief dimension (F(3, 1159) = 3.07, p < 0.05, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.008), and the Meaning of life dimension (F(3, 1161) = 5.27, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.013): in particular from the post-hoc it emerges how those who are unmarried/single perceive a lower level of Faith and belief and Meaning of life than those who are married/cohabiting.\r\nWith regard to the socio-relational variables, the Table 7 shows that as regards the variable people with the subject lives, significant differences emerge in Meaning of life (F(3, 1154) = 4.57, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.012). As for the Meaning of life dimension, post-hoc show how those who live with friends and roommates perceive lower levels of Meaning of life than those who live alone, with family or with a partner.\r\nWith regard to the Current job situation variable, as reported in Table 7, a significant difference emerges in Faith and belief dimension (F(3, 706) = 4.94, p < 0.01, \xce\xb7p2 = 0.014). From the post-hoc it emerges that those who have declared that their work situation has remained unchanged or have switched to smart-working perceive a higher level of Faith and belief than those who have lost their jobs or are on layoffs.\r\nRegarding the variable children (no children/children) significant differences emerge both in the dimension of Faith and belief (t(1159) = \xe2\x88\x924.63, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.27) and the dimension of Meaning of life (t(1160) = \xe2\x88\x924.053, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.24): those with children report higher levels of Faith and belief and Meaning of life than those who do not. Finally, with regard to the religious belief variable, from the t-test it emerges, as reported in Table 7, that there is a significant difference between those who declared to have a religious belief and those who do not with respect to all three dimensions: Faith and belief (t(1158) = \xe2\x88\x9236.33, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.16), Meaning of life (t(1156) = \xe2\x88\x924.91, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.29) and Quality of relationships (t(1168) = \xe2\x88\x922.02, p < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.12): those who have declared to have a religious belief perceive greater levels of Faith and belief, Meaning of life and Quality of relationships than those who have declared not to have religious belief.\r\nPearson's correlational analyses revealed that during the lockdown there was a positive correlation between the perception of spiritual well-being and the age of the participants: with increasing age of the participants, the perceived spiritual well-being increased (r = 0.153, p = 0.01). Furthermore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis has had a negative impact as regards mental health especially on younger people (r =-0.106, p = 0.01): in fact there is a negative relationship between the level of perceived mental health and the age of the participants: the risk of anxiety and stress decreases with increasing age. There is also a significant relationship between the GHQ-12 and the JSWB scale (r = \xe2\x88\x920.28, p < 0.05) and also in two of the three sub-dimensions, the Meaning of life (r = \xe2\x88\x920.17, p < 0.05) and Quality of relationships (r = \xe2\x88\x920.19, p < 0.05) in particular, there is a negative correlation between GHQ-12 and spiritual well-being: as perceived spiritual well-being decreases, perceived mental health malaise increases perceived by the participants, who are more at risk of anxiety and depression.\r\nFurther investigation highlighted the factors affecting Jarel Spiritual well-being and general health scale. The stepwise model selection in multiple linear regression analysis that considered JSWB scale as a dependent variable is presented in Table 8.\r\nRegression model: Jarel spiritual well-being scale (JSWB) as dependent variable.\r\nThe model has an R2 = 0.062, which means that 6% of the variance in JSWB scale is explained by the model. The R2-value was statistically significant. Mental health seems to be the biggest predictor (\xc3\x9f = \xe2\x88\x920.621, p < 0.01). While age (\xc3\x9f = 0.097, p < 0.01) and gender (\xc3\x9f = 2.346, p < 0.01) are moderate predictors.\r\nTable 9 presents the stepwise model selection in multiple linear regression analysis, in which GHQ-12 was used as a dependent variable.\r\nRegression model: General Health (GHQ-12) as dependent variable.\r\nThe model has an R2 = 0.04, which means that 4% of the variance in mental health is explained by the model. The R2-value was statistically significant. The JSWB scale seems to be the biggest predictor (\xc3\x9f = \xe2\x88\x920.059, p < 0.001). While gender (\xc3\x9f = 0.23, p < 0.001) is a moderate predictor.\r\nThis research, carried out during the lockdown period in Italy, has highlighted, in accordance with research carried out before the pandemic emergency event due to COVID-19 (19, 34, 34\xe2\x80\x9336, 41) how there is a connection between perceived spiritual well-being and mental and psychological health. Furthermore, the research by Gonz\xc3\xa1lez Sanguino et al. (73) has shown how spiritual well-being has been found to be a protective factor for depression and anxiety.\r\nThe data presented here show how our participants perceive both lower levels of spiritual well-being (45) and lower perception of positive mental health (72, 74) compared to the situation existing pre-pandemic. Furthermore, the period of the first lockdown in Italy seems to have had more significant effects on the mental health of the population than in other countries: Italians, in fact, record lower levels of mental health compared to those that emerged in a research conducted in the same period in the United Kingdom, where generalized lockdown was not in effect (75). However, these results are in line with previous research (76) which highlights how experiencing situations of crisis and bereavement can lead to the perception of poor spiritual well-being and greater psychological distress.\r\nWith regard to demographic variables, in relation to gender, it emerges that women perceive higher levels of spiritual well-being, in line with previous research (34, 45). In particular, women perceive greater Faith and belief than men. According to some authors, the higher scores of women's spiritual well-being could be linked to the fact that women have different experiences and coping strategies to men and also to the fact that religious norms and beliefs are more compatible with roles, characteristics and behaviors socially attributed to women (34, 77, 78). In relation, instead, to mental health, women show a lower perceived level of mental health, which confirms a constant of the previous literature (79\xe2\x80\x9381) and also relates to the period COVID-19 (49, 82\xe2\x80\x9384).\r\nWith regard to the age variable, the data showed that the younger participants (18\xe2\x80\x9324 years old) experienced a lower level of spiritual well-being, in particular Faith and belief and Meaning of life than people belonging to other age groups. In fact, from the literature it emerges that elderly people in particular benefit from religious practices and spiritual activities that positively affect their general well-being (3, 41).\r\nAlso, with regard to the perception of mental health, the data showed that the participants between 18 and 24 years old, the youngest participants, were the ones who were most affected by the lockdown situation, as also found in recent literature linked to the pandemic (85, 86). This condition of malaise could be due to the fact that young people suffered more from the lockdown restrictions because they are more used to living outside the home environment and according to Gonz\xc3\xa1lez-Sanguino et al. (73) this could also be due to the fact that younger participants have fewer resources and strategies to deal with crisis situations.\r\nWith regard to the marital status variable, the research also shows that singles have a lower level of spiritual well-being (in particular Faith and belief and Meaning of life) and mental health than those who are married or living together. This may be dictated by the fact that living as a couple can be considered a source of support in a lockdown situation in which social relations are limited to mere electronic contact (87, 88).\r\nAnalyzing the socio-relational variables, it emerged that those who live with friends and/or roommates perceive a lower level of spiritual well-being and in particular Meaning of life, than those who live alone or with family. This could also be due to age, a variable that was found to be negatively correlated with spiritual well-being; in fact, those who lived with friends or roommates were university students. Still in relation to the variable people with the subject lives, as regards mental health no significant differences emerged; this may be due to the fact that compared to the pre-pandemic period all the participants, regardless of the people they lived with during the lockdown, were significantly affected by the situation.\r\nInstead, in relation to the current job situation, it emerged that those who lost their jobs or had been laid off perceived lower levels of spiritual well-being, and in particular of Faith and belief, than those whose work situation had remained the same as before the lockdown or had switched to smart working. This is in line with that strand of literature which argues that people living in crisis situations perceive a low level of spiritual well-being (76). The fact that a difference with respect to mental health does not emerge may be due to the fact that the pandemic emergency situation led the participants to share the same destiny as regards their state of health, in which the working variable did not assume a significant weight at least in the initial stages of the emergency; an aspect that now, on the other hand, appears decidedly more salient and that the ever-increasing riots and protests in various countries are highlighting as a problematic condition.\r\nFurthermore, with respect to the children/no children variable, it emerged that those who do not have children perceive lower levels of spiritual well-being, in particular Faith and belief and Meaning of life than those who have children, this may be due to the fact that those who have children rely more on faith and spirituality. Carter (89) argues that for many families being involved in the congregation and their own spirituality are a source of strength, support and social support in the path of life together. Indeed, in the literature it has been found that the majority of families in the world, both within and beyond religious belief systems, use different forms of expression to satisfy their spiritual needs, particularly when facing adversity (20). Although spirituality and religion are two different constructs, literature shows strong correlations and overlaps; therefore, especially considering the high percentage of believers in our sample, it is evident that religion and church attendance in Italy, despite having decreased from the 1960s to today (90) still has a significant role and is probably even more fundamental for coping with this pandemic period (30), which may be more evident in families with children. Furthermore, the data also showed that those who do not have children have perceived lower levels of mental health than those who have.\r\nThis could be due to the fact that having to take care of a child leads to an increase in coping and resilience strategies, which positively affect psychological well-being (91). Furthermore, even though families faced numerous stresses during the lockdown (92, 93) they still reported a perception of greater mental health than singles who had to go through this period alone, in quarantine at home, inevitably perceiving less material and emotional support.\r\nFrom the analysis of the results, it also emerged that those who declared they had a religious belief perceived a higher level of spiritual well-being and reports higher levels in all its dimensions (Faith and belief, Meaning of life and Quality of relationships) than those who declared that they were atheist/agnostic or did not have a belief. This can be explained by the fact that, as previously seen, religion and spirituality are two closely related constructs (16\xe2\x80\x9318, 22) thus making it very likely that those who reported a religious belief benefited most in terms of perception of spiritual well-being. However, our data does not reveal a relationship between religious belief and mental health.\r\nThis finding is not confirmed in the research carried out in this pandemic situation by Pirutinsky et al. (37), who found that positive religious coping, intrinsic religiosity and trust in God were strongly correlated with less stress and more positive impact; Bentzen again (30), argues how people use religion to cope with the emotional stress caused by COVID-19, arguing how religiosity increases in response to unpredictable natural disasters, such as the COVID-19 crisis.\r\nWith respect to proximity to death, the data showed that those who know people who died from COVID-19 perceive higher levels of spiritual well-being precisely because, as also emerged in the literature (3, 7, 26), spirituality is considered a possible factor of resilience, which by positively affecting mental health, is crucial for those who are going through a grieving process, and who are also, in a similar situation, deprived of the possibility of implementing the typical rituals, such as the holding of funerals that were banned during the lockdown period, and which allowed people to accompany the deceased to burial, surrounded by the affection of friends and family and which contributed to the processing of the loss and mourning itself (13, 63).\r\nFinally, just as also found in the literature (3, 30, 34, 35, 41) the data showed that there is a relationship between spiritual well-being and mental health: from the analysis, in fact, it emerged that those who reported a lower level of spiritual well-being perceived a worse level of mental health. Finally, with regard to spiritual well-being, the data showed that mental health is the major predictor, while gender and age are moderate predictors. In fact, as also seen from the data reported previously and from the literature, age (3) and gender (34) have a significant impact on the perception of spiritual well-being.\r\nMental health, on the other hand, appears to be affected to a greater extent by spiritual well-being and to a lesser extent by gender. These data are confirmed by previous research which highlighted how spirituality and religious practices are a protective factor and closely connected to physical and mental health (3, 35, 41), as well as being a source of physical and psychological resilience (7, 39) and helping the development of coping strategies in people who experienced stressful life situations (34, 41), mitigating mood disorders such as depression and anxiety (19, 39).\r\nThe data presented give us a significant picture of the mental health situation experienced by the Italian population during the first lockdown and confirm the value of spiritual well-being as a protective factor of people's general well-being. However, we would like to outline some limitations of the research. Due to the contextual situation that involved a forced physical distance, the online questionnaire method seemed, despite the limits that this entails, the only possible strategy to reach a large number of subjects. Some limitations of the online questionnaire include the non-completion rate caused by the lower level of engagement than the paper questionnaire and the high number of questionnaires in circulation; moreover, a bias may be dictated by the type of careless response also highlighted in the literature (94). This choice of data collection was also confirmed by other researchers in relation to the COVID-19 epidemic (82). Furthermore, another limit, again related to data collection, is the type of sampling used: a random cascade sampling. Despite the research team's efforts to reach a large and diverse number of participants, use of the online questionnaire may not have allowed the involvement of some target populations. In spite of the weaknesses highlighted, this work has among its strengths the fact of being one of the first research studies conducted on the lockdown period related to COVID-19 in Italy which tries to investigate the role of spiritual well-being and its effects on individual well-being in the population with a multidisciplinary approach. This distance also led to a change in the outlook of some disciplines with a predominantly ethnographic approach, to try to get closer to the issues dealt with in a period such as that of the lockdown in which it was important that research continued to have its role of investigating and seeking knowledge despite non-essential activities having been stopped.\r\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, people and families experienced a new and sudden situation that forced them to stay indoors for a long period of time. In this context, many people and their families experienced situations of great discomfort, stress and fear related not only to the fear of contagion but also to the economic difficulties for those who saw their income reduced due to the closure of production activities or who experienced situations of loneliness, isolation or conflicts within the home. The pandemic has profoundly changed the way of life in society, starting from the need for \xe2\x80\x9csocial distancing\xe2\x80\x9d even among close relatives (87).\r\nIn this context it is very interesting to investigate if and how spirituality has been a form of emotional and psychological support useful for dealing with the loss and anguish of critical moments in life like this. This appears particularly dramatic for the families of those who died in hospital without being able to have their loved ones near them and without the latter being able to celebrate the funeral rites. The data from our study show that in the period of the lockdown those who were able to count on important forms of religiosity and spirituality drew mental well-being from these beliefs. Spirituality helped them to make sense of what was happening and not to feel lost in the face of the radical change in the way of living and conducting social relationships.\r\nLoss, grief, mental health, and spiritual well-being emerge as familiar themes in the lives of many individuals, families, and communities in different contexts. According to Zhai and Du (13) recognizing these individual experiences can enable healthcare professionals to develop personalized strategies to facilitate better adaptation to the situation and therefore promote mental health.\r\nIf looked at from the point of view of clinical practice, therefore, it can be seen that dealing with spirituality becomes fundamental; in fact, this aspect needs to be considered to really provide adequate support to individuals, especially those who manifest themselves as strong and solid.\r\nIn this regard, the consideration of spiritual needs is necessary to provide a holistic and people-centered intervention (95). By spiritual needs we mean everything that refers to the need to find meaning, value in one's life, peace and a sense of connection. These needs are not necessarily exclusively religious, even those who do not have a religious faith still refer to belief systems that provide feelings of meaning and purpose (46) which in this period of the COVID-19 pandemic seem to assume a role and an even deeper meaning in relation to the bewilderment that people are confronted with in the face of such a pervasive, disruptive event creating fragility, fear and daily uncertainties.\r\nIn a certain sense it is precisely at the moment of greatest difficulty that the need for support in spiritual terms becomes stronger, in the hope of finding comfort in one's faith and beliefs. Very often, however, we are faced with inadequate preparation in responding to this type of need (96). In fact, the importance of training health professionals so that they possess the skills to identify and support the spiritual discomfort of patients is increasingly evident (97). A distress which can lead to suffering, a state of anguish due to not being able to feel meaning in life in particular adverse moments, which in some way undermines personal identity (47, 48). Addressing psychosocial and spiritual needs can really contribute to the improvement (98) in the quality of life and well-being of individuals, especially at a time like the one the whole world is now facing and in which diagnostic and medical certainties become increasingly unsure and unconsolidated.\r\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\r\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Department of Education Sciences of the University of Genoa.

This unprecedented time prompts scholars of religion to reflect on how to strategically approach the study of religion in the time of \xe2\x80\x9csocial distancing,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as moving forward. Particularly important considerations include developing heuristic, innovative approaches for revealing ongoing changes to religion, as well as how religion continues to structure social life across a wide range of contexts, from the most intimate and personal to the most public and global. Although our note can only be indicative rather than exhaustive, we do suggest that the initial groundwork for reconsiderations might productively focus on several key analytical themes, including: Epidemiology, Ideology, Religious Practice, Religious Organizations and Institutions, as well as Epistemology and Methodology. In offering these considerations as a starting point, we remain aware (and hopeful) that inventive and unanticipated approaches will also emerge.\r\nAs we write this, the world remains mired in a global pandemic, with the rates of infection from a novel coronavirus continuing to rise. COVID-19 is still a new and inadequately understood upper respiratory infectious disease, with a rate of mortality that is high enough to have killed over 500,000 people to date globally. With delays in testing in some locations and insufficient knowledge, official estimates are still being corrected; nevertheless, the spike of known infections in March of 2020 moved national governments around the world to close businesses, places of worship, and schools\xe2\x80\x94essentially, any arena where people gathered in substantial numbers. By the end of April, the United States alone had reported over one million cases of COVID-19, and by the end of May, amidst the accumulation of infections, mortality in the United States reached a grim milestone of 100,000 deaths. By the time this paper is published, infections and deaths in the United States and elsewhere will not just be higher. They will be significantly higher.\r\nIn this brief note, we consider some of the ways that the global pandemic is altering the religious landscape, aiming our investigative lens to how religious institutions, congregations, and individuals are responding to the social changes wrought by COVID-19. Where should our analytical attention be focused?\r\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the related public health measures taken to mitigate the spread of the disease, and the varied public responses to the virus have far-reaching social implications. Religious institutions, communities, practices, beliefs, and identities present a particularly rich area for social scientific study, especially given the centrality of face-to-face and intimate gatherings typically associated with nearly all religious practices and traditions. Further, the death and mourning wrought by a pandemic would typically result in an increase in face-to-face gatherings and religious rituals; but given the need for social distancing and the necessity of adapting interaction to these constraints, the pandemic is triggering an increased need for religious traditions while at the same time significantly altering the expressions of those traditions. How religious institutions manage death and mourning\xe2\x80\x94two of the social moments religious leaders and institutions are most central to during normal times\xe2\x80\x94is a strategic location for viewing some of the ongoing changes to religion. In this we can see how the \xe2\x80\x9cdemand\xe2\x80\x9d for religious ritual, comfort, and support is presumably increased by the pandemic, while simultaneously the \xe2\x80\x9cavailable supply\xe2\x80\x9d of religion (in the form it is expected) is drastically decreased. So too the changes to levels of existential risk and the associated patterns of social engagement brought about by the pandemic offer social scientists numerous opportunities to explore important theoretical and practical questions regarding how conditions of change and uncertainty relate to private religious beliefs and practices.\r\nWhile the health risks of debilitation and death draw immediate attention, controversy rages on about how to handle the threat of COVID-19. Among the most basic points of dispute is the economy. The segregation of health issues into doctors\xe2\x80\x99 offices and hospitals, the relative isolation of severe illnesses, and the fact that the majority of people are either asymptomatic or as yet unaffected by the virus have prompted much attention on the economic impact of local, state, and federal governmental responses to the pandemic. For months, the slowing of the economy due to the sanctions on in-person gatherings and mandates to shelter-in-place has resulted in millions of people being financially affected by closings, furloughs, and layoffs, with sharp increases in unemployment. Immense pressure exists to \xe2\x80\x9cre-open the economy\xe2\x80\x9d out of a desperation to keep businesses running and to re-hire workers, with the use of \xe2\x80\x9cphases\xe2\x80\x9d to indicate the types of activities that could result (i.e., 1: bare essentials of food, health, and utilities; 2: limits on room capacity and enforced social distancing; 3: continued sanitization and expansion of social boundaries). The wearing of masks has been strongly encouraged, although selectively enforced and inconsistently modeled by political leaders. And mainstream news and various social media sources often add to polarization and obfuscation about re-opening the economy, resulting in decidedly split judgments on which experts are valid, which solutions are viable, and which practices are needed to address the pandemic. Likewise, calls to re-open the economy have been interwoven with demands to re-open churches, and restrictions on in-person gatherings that have limited religious services have been opposed as limiting \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d social services, and hence as an infringement of religious liberty.\r\nThe pandemic raises a number of important analytical considerations for researchers, from intra-individual and interactive, to larger organizational and cross-national implications. At a minimum, religion scholars will want to pay attention to how religious professionals have altered their leadership to accommodate social distancing, switching to a largely remote working environment. While the social spaces of many congregational leaders are shrinking considerably, other religious professionals have been called upon to play expanded roles. For instance, chaplains \xe2\x80\x9cusually do [their] work quietly, around the margins. But with the pandemic, their work has moved to the center of the American religious experience\xe2\x80\x9d (Cadge 2020). However, perhaps a broader re-imagining is possible in this moment. Just as the circumstances surrounding the pandemic have caused many people to rethink such systemic issues as racial inequality, health care provision, and the role of education in a thriving society, the mandated \xe2\x80\x9cpause\xe2\x80\x9d might allow religion scholars the time and space to more thoroughly revamp the study of religion in the twenty-first century, and to develop innovative approaches to understanding how religion continues to shape people\xe2\x80\x99s lives (see figure 1).\r\nTopics for Researchers of Religion to Consider in Relation to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\r\nOne critical way religious institutions and individuals will be central to analyses of the pandemic is as an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent variable\xe2\x80\x9d (Smilde and May 2015), including as a vector of disease transmission (Conger et al. 2020). Multiple instances have been documented of religious gatherings operating as \xe2\x80\x9csuperspreading events,\xe2\x80\x9d including cases in Washington (Hamner et al. 2020), Oregon (Cline 2020), California (Bizjak et al. 2020), Arkansas (James et al. 2020), and West Virginia (Nazaryan 2020) in the U.S. Religious gatherings have also been identified as important sites of virus transmission in Germany (Boston 2020) and South Korea (Shin et al. 2020). While most congregations followed state orders to close, some resisted such orders, staying open and risking arrest. Still others innovated by developing \xe2\x80\x9cdrive-in\xe2\x80\x9d church services that likely still posed some dangers to the health of attendees.\r\nThe centrality of intensive interactive rituals for producing the communal benefits of religion (e.g., social support, emotional catharsis, perceived healing) ensures that there will be persistent tension between many religious groups\xe2\x80\x99 desire for in-person gatherings and the social distancing requirements necessary to limit the spread of COVID-19. To the extent that religious individuals and their related groups believe in-person collective experiences are essential to their religiosity, social identity, and well-being, they may continue in-person gathering to the limits of (or even beyond) social distancing policies. At the same time, social connections among members within congregations may lead to the urging of doctor visits, care for symptoms as they emerge, and practical assistance for medical bills, making congregational participation a potentially important factor in treating and overcoming disease (see Benjamins et al. 2011).\r\nA central consideration on this topic is the extent to which different religious traditions and worldviews emphasize particular orientations, such as individualistic versus collectivist orientations, care for the vulnerable, and neoliberal economics. Sorting out the different ways that religion relates to the spread of disease and care for the sick stands as an opportunity for researchers in the field of religion and health to contribute to the wider body of knowledge about the pandemic. Although religion is never truly an \xe2\x80\x9cindependent variable\xe2\x80\x9d because of its historical and ongoing relationship to other facets of social life, particularly race/ethnicity, social class, and gender (Wilde 2018), it is nonetheless critical to investigate and document how religion influences behavioral patterns that are directly related to disease transmission and mitigation. Likewise, in the case of the United States, the reciprocal and intensifying relationship between religion and partisanship ensures that (Margolis 2018), to the extent that public policies and actions toward COVID-19 are politicized, religion is a critical consideration for a full understanding of social distancing actions (or inactions).\r\n\r\nReligion will also likely be assessed as a complex system of beliefs that are shared and contested. A key consideration here is religion and science, for which a number of issues are immediately notable for both quantitative and qualitative study. Central among these are whether and how religious identity, beliefs, and practices relate to behaviors undertaken (or avoided) in response to social distancing requirements, such as avoiding gatherings, vaccine hesitancy, or wearing face masks, to name but a few. For example, wearing masks has become a strong point of contention, with some insisting that masks are ineffective and unnecessary (as long as one has enough faith and courage). Those who refuse to wear masks include many who believe mask wearing bows to the dictate of \xe2\x80\x9cthe State,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore restricts a person\xe2\x80\x99s God-given freedom. Coupled with this, many believe that mask wearing bows to the dictates of science, which is viewed as unreliable, especially in contrast to the strength of one\xe2\x80\x99s own spiritual devotion for providing unseen, and therefore miraculous, protection.\r\nAlready, there is evidence emerging that religious views are consequentially connected to following (or ignoring) such social distancing practices (Hill et al., Forthcoming; Perry et al., Forthcoming). Notably, these patterns fall along distinctively gendered lines in relation to religion (Smothers et al., Forthcoming). At least four dimensions of religiosity are worth exploring in regard to their connection to social distancing behaviors: (1) certainty of beliefs, (2) perceptions of invulnerability, (3) collectivist versus individualist orientations, and (4) the centrality and intensity of collective rituals. Certainty and exclusivity of an ideological framework can relate to the distrust of authority from other institutions, such as science or medicine (Baker et al. 2020). An important contextual consideration is the extent to which these aspects of religion are connected to social dynamics of race (see Yukich and Edgell 2020), and how the differential racial impact of the pandemic may therefore be connected to religiosity in ways that differ along racial and ethnic lines. Another important contextual consideration, at least in the United States., is the increasing politicization about views about science and religion (O\xe2\x80\x99Brien and Noy, Forthcoming).\r\nFurther, public opinion about the pandemic and social policies for mitigation cannot be fully understood without consideration of multiple aspects of religiosity and worldview.1 Approaching religion in the pandemic from a different angle, the responses of clergy and religious elites to the hardship of the pandemic provide ample opportunity for systematic studies of multiple dimensions of ideology, including theodicy, the relation of particular religious traditions to scientific authority, and in some cases claims and experiences of miraculous healing. The analysis of official rhetoric and communications offers an opportunity to look at how representatives of different traditions frame suffering and death in the face of widespread injustice and tragedy. In the sense that theodicy provides a crucial window into the larger ideology of traditions (Berger 1967), comparative and in-depth qualitative analyses hold much promise for revealing important connections between religious groups, their practices and experiences, and their larger cultural environments.\r\nBeyond religious elites, popular assessments of rumors about what is true also warrant focused attention from researchers. Weber\xe2\x80\x99s ((1922) 1993) interest in different forms of authority, including charismatic authority, places questions about the social construction of \xe2\x80\x9ctruth\xe2\x80\x9d squarely in the realm of sociology of religion. Religion scholars might, for example, examine the proliferation, consumption, and spread of conspiracy theories about the pandemic. Although not necessarily related to formal religion (although sometimes they are), conspiracy theories contain a number of quasi-religious elements (Bader et al. 2020; Robertson 2016), and social scientists studying religion can assist with evaluating the relative diffusion, as well as the patterns and consequences, of conspiracy theories. Conspiratorial beliefs about the pandemic have already been spliced into existing conspiracy subcultures, such as the ones spun by Alex Jones or the anonymous online denizens of QAnon (Frenkel et al. 2020). Importantly, acceptance of conspiracy theories has consequences for political behavior (Oliver and Wood 2014a), health behaviors such as vaccine resistance (Oliver and Wood 2014b), and general social well-being, including trust in other people and the purchasing of firearms out of fear (Bader et al. 2020). Scholars of religion should not overlook this aspect of the pandemic, but rather contribute positively to this area of research.\r\nReligion will also continue to be analyzed as a set of emerging and established practices (Ammerman 2020; Wuthnow 2020). Thinking about religion as the object of analysis and its role in disease transmission, a clear and consequential way that the pandemic has changed religion is the suspension of in-person religious gatherings, and the corresponding need to engage in \xe2\x80\x9csocially distanced\xe2\x80\x9d forms of interactive religious services and rituals. Religious groups have used a wide range of technological innovations to fill the void left by in-person gatherings, from teleconferenced Seders to drive-in church services broadcast on radio stations, and increasingly in video chat memorial services. How long such mediated substitutions are necessary for interactive rituals remains an open question depending on groups\xe2\x80\x99 locations, orientations toward social distancing measures, and congregants\xe2\x80\x99 levels of fear and reticence about interactions in public spaces. Even when congregations do return to face-to-face gatherings, there may be changes to interaction rituals, particularly those involving physical contact, singing, and ingestion. Five possible implications of these changes can be seen in: (1) the privatization of religiosity; (2) asynchronous consumption of and participation in religious services; (3) a shifting of conditions in the religious environment to favor groups that are already technologically advanced and adequately staffed to facilitate technologically-mediated religious innovation and distribution; (4) religious organizations and their civic engagement with the local community; and (5) conflicts between religious groups and local, state, and federal governments regarding social gatherings.\r\nA notable consequence of the pandemic may be further advancing the pre-existing processes toward the privatization of religiosity (e.g., Chaves 2017; Houtman and Aupers 2007). Even for those continuing to participate in their religious communities remotely via mediated interaction, a qualitative shift toward the privatization of religious practice necessarily occurs. The long-term consequences of these shifts will depend on the extent and length of social distancing requirements, as well as whether and how people reintegrate physical co-presence within religious communities after social distancing requirements are reduced. While we can reasonably expect an acceleration of pre-existing trends toward religious privatization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the degree and expressions of this privatization remain to be seen and documented. The pandemic may also accelerate trends associated with secularization. To the extent that religious participation is habit based and interrupted by social distancing, it may facilitate the exit of some from active religious participation. So rather than a V-shaped pattern in religious participation after the easing of social distancing, returns to religious practice may well not reach their pre-pandemic levels. Undoubtedly, some of this will be a transition to the privatization of religion, but some will also likely simply be declining levels of religiosity. Generating adequate measures to map the extent of privatization versus secularization will be a key consideration for researchers.\r\nA related consequence is the increasing production and consumption of religious services and rituals via asynchronous communication. A primary example of this trend is the vast reduction of the annual hajj to Mecca in 2020, the first time this Pillar of Islam has been curtailed since the mid-1800s (Hubbard and Walsh 2020). More generally, by removing the physical co-presence of group services, music, and rites, a foundational element of the positive affect produced by efficacious interactive rituals is removed (Collins 2005). In essence, the Durkheim ((1912) 1995) pathway to collective effervescence is substantially and negatively altered. While not all emotion is removed, an important shift has taken place that removes groups\xe2\x80\x99 abilities to generate shared rhythm and mood (on the positive side of generating group cohesion), and severely reduces or removes groups\xe2\x80\x99 abilities to police participation and norms (on the negative side of the social dynamics that create group cohesion) (see Draper 2019; Wellman et al. 2020). So, while individuals may passively consume religious interactions or individually engage in rites and sacraments, the longer-term aspects of group cohesion and the accompanying social identities it generates are imperiled. Beyond the experience of worship itself, the ability to mobilize and recruit volunteers for the practical needs of religiously motivated ministries, as well as generating financial contributions, are also challenged when members are deprived of the opportunity to interact face-to-face. Encouraging use of digital platforms for charitable giving will also become much more important. Notably, this places particular challenges on poorer individuals and religious congregations, where members\xe2\x80\x99 access to electronic forms of capital transfer may be limited. As charitable giving is re-directed from in-person to remote, organizations with a larger cache of financial resources have considerable advantages for long-term survival and success by virtue of their ability to weather potential downturns in financial giving, although the challenge of fundraising is a constant concern, even for seemingly stable organizations (Mart\xc3\xad and Mulder 2020; Mulder and Mart\xc3\xad 2020).\r\nRelated to the shift toward mediated communication for interactive rituals, groups and organizations that already emphasized the use of such technologies before the imposition of social distancing requirements have a clear competitive advantage for the maintenance of their organizations compared to groups who were more heavily reliant on face-to-face interactions. Streaming services, both live and recorded, have become more common recently, and many congregations had already invested in the equipment and personnel to provide access to their services remotely. Regarding communal rituals such as weddings, technology has been used to allow small in-person gatherings while providing remote participation for broader networks of family and friends. Similarly, in relation to bereavement and death, online options have opened to conduct funeral services that allow involvement and interaction through video. Organizations\xe2\x80\x99 access to capital resources will affect their ability to upgrade communication technologies to substitute for face-to-face gatherings during periods of social distancing.\r\nThe pandemic also provides an opportunity to examine the role of religious organizations in social support for communities\xe2\x80\x99 members. For both the medical and economic hardships wrought by the pandemic and related social distancing measures, religious groups and individuals are playing important roles for formal and informal social support. For example, we know that religious congregations have been important sources of immediate assistance, from food pantries to supplemental funds to assist with costs associated with housing, medicine, and transportation. The changing landscape for religious nonprofits and local social service provisions organized through congregations are key domains for changes in the dynamics of formal social support. For informal social support, the provisions put in place by denominational organizations and local congregations to care for members during times of physical and financial hardship warrant explicit attention from researchers. Conversely, the limitations placed on faith-based organizing and political engagement by social distancing should also be carefully documented. For instance, in light of a surge of protests connected to the \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Lives Matter\xe2\x80\x9d movement spurred on by the death of George Floyd on May 25th, 2020, there is evidence that the lull in congregational activity allowed logistical space for church leaders to redirect their energies toward mobilizing their ministries to participate in protests that publicly advocate against racial injustice. Thus, an intriguing and unintended consequence of closed church services may have been allowing for the expansion of community and civic engagement beyond sanctuaries (see Beyerlein and Ryan 2018).\r\nFinally, at an institutional level, there are a number of opportunities for examining interesting and consequential issues involving the intersection of religion and law. Thousands of religious groups received forgivable loans of up to 10 million dollars through the Paycheck Protection Program, which was part of a 669-billion-dollar economic stimulus package; support that some groups have strongly criticized. The U.S. Roman Catholic Church alone gained at least $1.4 billion in this taxpayer-backed aid (and may have even exceeded $3.5 billion; see Dunklin and Rezendes 2020). Early reports also raised questions as to whether different religious groups were equally likely to receive support. The urge to re-start worship services given the pragmatic issues of accepting donations and the mobilization of volunteers for all sorts of ministries and services accomplished through the congregation have prompted aggressive calls for religious exemptions for church gatherings. On one end, some churches have insisted on a drive-in church option to ensure proper distancing and provide access to services for those without the technological means to access services remotely. On the other end, most churches who insist on continuing to meet physically have stated their intent to sanitize sanctuaries, provide masks, and generously space seating. Some churches have sued their state governments, insisting that congregations are \xe2\x80\x9cessential businesses\xe2\x80\x9d and citing \xe2\x80\x9creligious liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, there appears to be a resonance between those who agitate for re-opening the churches and those who agitate for re-opening the economy\xe2\x80\x94a Christian libertarian affinity that insists open churches and businesses are what is needed to keep America strong (see Mart\xc3\xad 2020a, 2020b).\r\nWhether and how religious organizations, groups, and individuals are restricted from particular practices in order to limit the spread of disease necessarily raises points of tension about the legal parameters of religious freedom. Accordingly, there will likely be waves of court cases across national, state, and local contexts dealing with issues related to social distancing and the rights of religious expression. Some of these issues have already been taken up by high courts, such as the South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom (2020) case, where the Supreme Court of the United States denied injunctive relief to a church in California that did not want to follow social distancing restrictions on public gatherings. Soon after, churches in California filed suit in federal court challenging the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s ban on singing in houses of worship (Calvary Chapel of Ukiah et al. v. Newsom et al.). Many other similar cases will undoubtedly follow, and documenting how and why the legal boundaries surrounding religious freedom are remade in the ongoing and eventually post-pandemic landscape provides ample opportunity for meaningful study (see Bennett 2017; Wenger 2017).\r\nA final consideration for social scientists studying religion during and after the COVID-19 pandemic concerns methodology, and to an extent, the broader epistemology undergirding the study of religion. Methodologically, many of the most vital tools available for studying religion, particularly those that are qualitative in orientation, are restricted by the need for social distancing. Ethnographic, observational, and interview methods are all severely constrained by the reduction of in-person gatherings and the limitations on face-to-face interaction. Of course, these are the precisely the methods that are needed to document the ongoing changes to structure and meaning of religion. Consequently, researchers must be innovative in their use of digital technologies for the application of qualitative analyses, including but not limited to the use of online archives, digital ethnography, and alternative interview formats. In addition, the use of unobtrusive measures may become especially important as we seek to examine materials without the ability to observe as much in situ (see Webb et al. 2000).\r\nBeyond the need to be methodologically innovative and resourceful, the changes to the social contexts of religion that we have detailed above also raise important epistemological and theoretical considerations for the sociology of religion. As religious adherents\xe2\x80\x99 definitions of worship and ritual life undergo reconsideration and change, researchers should pursue these emerging epistemologies by creatively tracking them. Cutting-edge work in the field, such as the focus on \xe2\x80\x9clived religion\xe2\x80\x9d (Ammerman 2014; McGuire 2008, 2016), has already raised many of these questions. Now, however, such considerations about the meaning of religion in the contemporary world\xe2\x80\x94and how we should approach it as researchers and theorists\xe2\x80\x94can no longer be ignored.\r\nRather than being prescriptive, this note is intended as an encouragement to our colleagues. Given that COVID-19 emerged as a public health crisis only a few months ago, sociologists of religion are only beginning to grapple with the many unanticipated and unseen dynamics of this global phenomenon. These happenings were playing out as most social scientists were also moving their professional lives into quarantine, taking on new roles, getting trained in social distancing practices, and managing the radical uncertainty of their work and home lives. As the circumstances of the pandemic normalize, as acceptable risks and potential vaccines emerge, and as the ability to secure analytical focus returns, there is no doubt that clever, insightful, and not-yet-fully apparent means of analyzing and revealing profound structural patterns will emerge. Even as we are mournful of the suffering and tragedy the world continues to endure, we are hopeful that the creative and capable researchers who comprise our field will find ways to add their voices to the emergent understanding of how the world has changed in light of COVID-19, and perhaps better prepare us for the many unknowns of our collective future.\r\nOur discussion here is neither comprehensive nor exhaustive, and no one can foresee all the ways that religion will influence and in turn be affected by the ongoing pandemic. We anticipate that the list of topics brought into new relief by the ongoing pandemic will grow ever-larger over time. Still, we hope the considerations we have outlined are the beginning of productive dialog in the field.\r\n1It is worth noting that secularity will also be related to social distancing attitudes and behaviors, and should be studied accordingly. We are focusing here on aspects of religion, but secular attitudes and identities should be considered from a similar perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Center for\r\n                        Biotechnology Information,\r\n                 U.S. National Library of Medicine\r\n\r\n8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda\r\nMD, 20894\r\nUSA\r\n\r\n\r\n%PDF-1.7\r\n%\xc3\xa2\xc3\xa3\xc3\x8f\xc3\x93\r\n79 0 obj\r\n<>stream\r\nx\xc5\x93+\xc3\xa4  \xc3\xae |\r\nendstream\r\nendobj\r\n6 0 obj\r\n<>stream\r\nx\xc5\x93\xc2\xbdY\xc3\x9dn\xc3\x9b6\xc2\xbe7\xc3\xa0w\xc3\xa0\xc2\xa5\xc2\xb4\xc3\x99\xc5\x92\xc3\xb8'\xc5\xa0]Qlu\xc3\x9a4C\xc6\x92eK\xc2\xb2^\xc2\xbbPb\xc3\x85\r\nThis article is an attempt to document the intersectionality of religion with COVID-19. Religion in a general sense is a reservoir of resources to which believers turn, especially in times of crisis. Religion offers explanations as to what is happening and also proposes means of mitigation. This article aims\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0look for highlights of these two responses from religion in different areas of the world, with a particular focus on India.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nReligion is the medium through which humans forge threads of connectedness in varying degrees. Different religious systems that have their origins in specific cultural locations render the connections between humans in culturally mediated patterns. The mandate of the World Health Organization (WHO) geared towards protecting humanity from the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic involves corporeal distance between people, which seems at first glance to be diagonally opposite of what religion stands for. However, the tension between the familiar and the mysterious,\xc2\xa0the proximate and the distant, is integral to intersubjectivity, particularly in the domain of religion. The manner in which religion performs the role of mitigating this tension gets amplified in times of a pandemic of a scale as that of COVID-19.\r\nThe mandate of the WHO which hinges on physical\xc2\xa0distancing\xc2\xa0as a proven response to halt the spread of the coronavirus meant that for the religiously oriented people, life would not be normal for some time to come. Followers of religions have responded to these altered realities in different ways. While some have found religiously sanctioned instructions symmetrical to the guidelines given by WHO, others have discovered in the repository a mandate not just to accept the WHO guidelines on face value but to oppose them on religious grounds, as deliberate attempts to undermine the influence of religion in public life.\xc2\xa0\r\nThe experiential dimension of religion is sustained by rites, rituals, pilgrimages and ceremonies. The performance and participation of the specialists and the non-specialists in these heightened moments of consciousness constitutes the experience of religion for its practitioners. The measures put in place by governments across the world to arrest the spread of COVID-19 resulted in alteration and disruption of these performative aspects of religion leaving the believers to improvise, interpret and explore new avenues and alternatives. The speed at which a distinction was marked between the offline and the online modes of some of the rituals and ceremonies bears testimony to the continuing value of religion and the tenacity of believers to adapt the rigid, formulaic and ritually binding performances of normal times to the fast-changing reality of the pandemic-infected world. Satsang, poojas, artis, religious discourses, ritual performances, and darshan have all metamorphosed in lightning speed to the online mode; something unthinkable in pre-pandemic times.\r\nFor believers, religion constitutes an explanatory system par excellence. It assists the believers to make sense of what is happening around them and the world at large by positing a world view or cosmology1\xc2\xa0(Geertz 1993: 87\xe2\x80\x93125). Believers have taken recourse to religion in general and religious leaders in particular for cogent explanations on the world in the times of COVID-19. The range of religiously couched explanations are galore and originate from various standpoints. One of the common explanations that religions offer for the pandemic is that it is a visible sign of human frailty and culpability. Since reports suggested that the origin of the virus was from wet animal markets in Wuhan, the human propensity to encroach on the animal world in disproportionate ways, even against the divine will, was touted as a necessary condition that resulted in the origin and initial spread of the virus (Carrington 2020; Ivereigh 2020).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nAn explanation suggested by religious experts depicts the pandemic as an essential part of the human predicament. The only reasonable response to it is to be more humane and sensitive to the rest of humanity who are comparatively exposed more to misery and hardships than oneself. One of the prominent responses of the people of faith has been an outpouring of humanitarian aid and assistance to those at the receiving end of the scourge of the pandemic. Instances of such a response included, among others, the members of the Tablighi Jamaat who turned plasma donors, the members of the Sikh organisations who organised langar for the affected people, charitable trusts managed by religious organisations across the world, and particularly in India, which\xc2\xa0embarked on a massive outreach to the people affected by the virus as well as by the unprecedented lockdown (Ahmed 2020; Trivedi 2020; Art of Living 2020; Belur Math Media Gallery 2020; Gomes 2020).\xc2\xa0\r\nSome influential religious leaders have found a link between the coronavirus and the imageries of the apocalypse, end times and the time of retribution mentioned in their scriptures. The metaphor of the end of the world and the day of judgment is etched vividly on the pages of the holy book of the Semitic religions accompanied by descriptions of signs and portents. Similar themes with vivid portrayals of the end times and the day of judgment are plenty in cinematic representation mediated through Hollywood films. Consequently, leaders of Semitic religions have hitched on to the imageries of the end of times to explain COVID-19 and its after effects. One of the signs mentioned in the scriptures dealing with the end of time is a pestilence of a massive scale. Some religious leaders have turned themselves into doomsday prophets and invoked this imagery to make sense of the pandemic as a sign of the end of time, exhorting their followers to take note of the signs and portends and getting themselves ready for the end (Jeremy 2020).\r\nConspiracy theories constitute yet another mode of explanation for the pandemic among the believers of various religions. Such theories and explanations flourish in times of upheaval and uncertainty. Some of the theories point out to the virus as intentionally created by the atheistic Chinese and spread to the rest of the world in a calculated manner to wreak havoc on the believers. Some conservative Christians across the world, particularly in the United States (US) consider the virus to be a hoax, created and sustained in a mediatised world through deliberate propaganda to suit the ideologies of certain political parties (Romano 2020). Anchors of some television news channels in India portrayed the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi in March 2020 as part of the conspiracy to spread the coronavirus in India (Jha 2020).\xc2\xa0\r\nSome have added conspiracy theories and explanations to the massive effort launched for a vaccine for the virus. There is a long-standing trend of religious leaders employing religious language to portray vaccination as part of a geo-political conspiracy. For some time now, there have been reports of the Taliban launching campaigns against polio vaccination in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan. The anti-vaccination tenor of religious leaders has surfaced once again, this time referring to the efforts towards a\xc2\xa0vaccine for COVID-19. Interestingly, some of the reports coming from Latin American countries describe how some Christian pastors are denouncing Bill Gates as the kingpin of the vaccine conspiracies. For instance, a Colombian pastor couple with substantial following on Instagram talked about how the vaccine for the coronavirus would be embedded with a microchip called "ID2020,"\xc2\xa0manufactured by Bill Gates and\xc2\xa0aimed at creating a database of all those who are inoculated, in order to employ that database for the spread of the messages of the Antichrist (Longoria et al 2020; Weiss and Greenstreet 2020). At the start of the outbreak in India, there was talk of \xe2\x80\x9ccorona jihad\xe2\x80\x9d to portray a conspiracy that Muslims wanted to speed up the spread of the virus. Kapil Mishra, a local leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Delhi had stated then that the members of the Tablighi Jamaat deliberately acted to spread the virus as widely as possible (Ellis-Peterson 2020).\xc2\xa0\r\nConspiracy theories couched in religious language and peddled by religious leaders take on added legitimacy and urgency when they are simultaneously endorsed and propagated by entrenched political ideologies. The world has increasingly tilted\xc2\xa0towards isolationist nationalism, cultural nationalism, and majoritarianism, that along with the ascendance of right-wing ideologies have amplified the conspiracy theories about the pandemic. In spaces where majoritarianism and cultural nationalism have reached a crescendo, the interventions by the state as well as public opinion orchestrated by certain organisations and entities (particularly those in the media industry) have reinforced the anti-minority tenor of state-sponsored propaganda and politics. The tag of \xe2\x80\x9csuper spreader\xe2\x80\x9d attributed to the congregation of Tablighi Jamaat in March 2020 in New Delhi, the subsequent onslaught of a media witch hunt, arrests and charge sheeting\xc2\xa0of the organisers and participants, including foreign nationals, and the subsequent acquittal of the latter in the courts of law exemplify\xc2\xa0the ways in which the pandemic has been an occasion for buttressing and reinforcing the entrenched majoritarian politics.2\xc2\xa0\r\nThe availability of an assorted number of ritual performances and online congregations opened up multiple possibilities for believers. It rendered the constriction of space redundant as one could choose to log on to a ritual performance, congregation, satsang or service that was happening anywhere in the world. One is no longer confined to the local temple, mosque, church or gurdwara for participation in religious performances. For instance, a Catholic believer would now have the possibility of watching an online mass conducted by the Pope himself. One could choose the time and the place where\xc2\xa0the rituals and performances are being conducted. The mediated nature of the virtual which supplants the real got extended to the domain of religion in more visible and emphatic ways than ever imagined before.\r\nIt also opened up the possibility of new players entering the arena of ritual performances and authorised religious practices. Robbed of the possibility of tapping into one's\xc2\xa0regular visits to the shrine in the neighbourhood for religious nourishment, the altered times offered the possibility for the religiously innovative to embark on breaking the boundaries of authorised performances and imagining\xc2\xa0new possibilities. For instance, the stranglehold of patriarchy over religious authority and ritual hierarchy gets diluted in a scenario where the entire gamut of rituals and ceremonies have gone online. This opens up the space for new performers and new forms of ritual performance. For those wanting to democratise the realm of ritual performance, the pandemic-induced world offers many pathways. With the cessation of regular pujas, services and other communal practices in religious shrines, the custodians of ritualised religion are apprehensive about the financial fallout as well as the possibility that the believer or devotee may get used to the altered circumstances and may not patronise the shrines as intensely as before once the situation becomes normal. However, even with the possibilities opened up by the virtual space, the entitled ritual specialists too sought unique ways of guarding their monopolistic hold on ritual and authorised practice.\xc2\xa0\r\nThere have been voices of outrage among believers in the way states and governmental agencies are enforcing closure of communal worship and services. For many believers, communal worship is an essential part of their lives, especially in crisis situations. They lament the fact that while communal services stand banned in many places, supermarkets and commercial establishments which attract larger crowds are allowed to operate. In some places, believers discretely broke the law to sustain their commitment to congregational worship. A report in the Guardian from 22 November\xc2\xa02020 gave details of such attempts across the United Kingdom (Sherwood 2020). Deeming such practices as amounting to unavoidable acts of civil disobedience, the participants spoke of the need to be connected to the divine in communal worship now more than at any other time. A statement by a Christian pastor\xc2\xa0captures this sentiment the best: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the government has the authority to tell the church of Jesus Christ that it can\xe2\x80\x99t gather for worship. They have provided no evidence, they just classed us as non-essential. But we believe worship is the most essential thing in life\xe2\x80\x9d (Sherwood 2020).\xc2\xa0\r\nFor believers, one of the crucial functions of religion is in the realm of the therapeutic. They turn to religion in times of affliction and grief with marked intensity than at other times. Memories of divine intervention in times of large-scale affliction are etched in religious monuments and installations all across the globe.3\xc2\xa0Epidemics and pandemics are times when the believers would turn to religion and religiously sanctioned practices for relief, protection and healing. It is no wonder then that it is in the realm of religion that many believers have endeavoured to find solace and cure for COVID-19 as well. The therapeutic and the cathartic aspects of religion coupled with the power and authority that believers bestow on religious leaders and faith healers have given rise to multiple claims of cures for the pandemic from across the globe. These cures include,\xc2\xa0among other things,\xc2\xa0cow urine, chlorine dioxide solution, magic beans, consecrated oil, and so on.\xc2\xa0\r\nIn certain circles, the pandemic-induced transformation and curtailment of religious rituals, pilgrimages, and ceremonies have triggered a debate on the very nature of religion wherein the older debate of spirituality versus ritualism is taking on newer dimensions of engagement. COVID-19 and the attendant problems that humans face is interpreted as a \xe2\x80\x9cspiritual struggle\xe2\x80\x9d that affects believers and non-believers alike, and religions are imagined as avenues for bringing solace to humanity in different ways. Those believers whose very understanding of religion is based on the ethical dimensions rather than the ceremonial have stressed on the opportunity that the coronavirus pandemic has allowed believers to free themselves of the ritualism that has crept in many aspects of religious belief and practice. On the other hand, believers whose approach to religion is more through rituals and ceremonies have either faced a crisis of sorts during the pandemic or have adapted themselves to the online mode.\xc2\xa0\r\nThe pandemic has also been an occasion for the\xc2\xa0reiteration of yet another debate between religion and science. Votaries of science and the scientific temper, with a corresponding disenchantment for religious beliefs and practices, have had a field day disparaging the various attempts of religiously inspired people across the globe touting cures and preventive therapies for the religiously enchanted. Results of preliminary studies on the status of belief and religious practices in the times of the pandemic suggest that at least in certain locations, there has been an enhanced value given to religiously sanctioned ways of explaining and responding to the present situation. This includes a spurt in religious beliefs and practices such as prayers, fasts, vows, and vicarious sacrifices. For instance, in a study conducted in Poland, the authors found a rise in religiosity and religious practice among the young and elderly people (Kowalczyk et al 2020). Similarly, a quarter of the respondents in the US to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre said that their faith has grown amidst the pandemic and only 2% suggested that their faith has weakened in the wake of the pandemic (Grecewicz 2020).\xc2\xa0\r\nAs a domain of human enterprise that seeks to deal with questions of ultimate significance and connecting those questions to the mundane attitudes and activities of everyday life, an analysis of the role of religion in times of the public health crisis such as COVID-19 is crucial. A cursory mapping of some of the prominent trends reported from around the world provides a religious canvas of multiple responses which are\xc2\xa0often contradictory.\xc2\xa0No matter\xc2\xa0the response that\xc2\xa0believers have adopted in terms of explanation, mitigation, and coping strategies, religion has been a major moving force, particularly in the time of the pandemic.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nView the discussion thread.\r\n320-322, A to Z Industrial Estate, Ganpatrao Kadam Marg, Lower Parel, Mumbai, India 400 013\r\nPhone: +91-22-40638282 \xc2\xa0 |\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fax: +91-22-24934515 \xc2\xa0 | \xc2\xa0 Email: Editorial - edit@epw.in \xc2\xa0| \xc2\xa0Subscription - circulation@epw.in \xc2\xa0 | \xc2\xa0 Advertisement - advertisement@epw.in\xc2\xa0\r\nDesigned, developed and maintained by\xc2\xa0Yodasoft Technologies Pvt.
